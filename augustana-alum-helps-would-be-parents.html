Near the end of a frustrating appointment with a fertility specialist, she was told she had “unexplained infertility.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/Pher3.jpeg><p>“At the time, I was doing precision oncology cancer research. On this side of the hallway, I’m spending 80 hours a week trying to find personalized cancer therapies for people,” she recalled in the Augie release. “And across the hall I’m told, ‘You have unexplained infertility, we don’t know what’s wrong.’”</p><p>Then they handed her a pre-prepared loan application for $10,000 to cover the treatment. “And I said, ‘What are you treating if you don’t know what’s wrong?’”</p><p>As a research scientist, Hintzsche knew what to do when something was unexplained. She also knew she didn’t want to buy expensive treatment for an unknown problem. With both the emotional conviction and the scientific background, she decided to dig in and find out for herself.&nbsp;</p><p>In her research, she found that for unexplained infertility, a small group of people were finding success with a different type of treatment, much less expensive, in the clinical setting, according to Augustana.</p><p>Her first thought was, “Why wasn’t I offered this treatment?” Second, “Why can’t I do this at home?”&nbsp;</p><p>These questions started Hintzsche on a path that led to PherDal Fertility Science and “the&nbsp;only sterile, FDA-cleared, patented, at-home insemination kit.”&nbsp;Patented since 2022, the device received FDA clearance in December 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Each PherDal kit includes three sterile, individually wrapped syringes and collection jars, step-by-step instructions and video instructions. Mailing packages are blank, to maintain privacy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/Pher2.jpg><p>The process, from the start of her inquiry to the final product, was aided by access to the right kind of supplies in her research lab, connections with people who believed in her vision, and the fact she had “married a really great guy who went along with the plan,” she said.</p><p><strong>A five-year success story</strong><strong></strong></p><p>In January 2018, she received her first evidence: a positive pregnancy test. Now 5 years old, daughter Lois was conceived in only the second month using the PherDal kit. Hintzsche and her husband Ryan also have a 4-year-old son, Zack.&nbsp;</p><p>Today people can pay $200 for this safe&nbsp;and private&nbsp;fertility kit, arriving by mail in&nbsp;discreet&nbsp;packaging, instead of paying thousands of dollars for clinical treatment. Though not a clinical trial, the reported numbers are good; within 90 days she sold the first 200 kits. This led to 34 babies, including a pair of siblings.&nbsp;</p><p>Hintzsche said it all began at Augustana.&nbsp;</p><p>Her grandmother Lois and then two more grandparents passed away while she was in college, all from cancer. This motivated her to join the effort to cure cancer. She started as a pre-med major, but quickly changed to chemistry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/03/Pher4.png><p>In her junior year, she knew she liked science, but she wasn’t a star student and didn’t know what to do. One day she found herself sitting in the office of her immunology professor Dr. Dara Wegman-Geedey, saying, “I clearly can’t go to grad school, I’ll never become a doctor like you.”&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Wegman-Geedey stopped her right there and asked, “Why?”&nbsp;</p><p>What her professor said to her next changed everything: “I never got an A in a biology class as an undergrad, and here I sit with a Ph.D. You don’t need a 4.0 to go to grad school — I had a 2.87 GPA in college, and maybe two Bs in biology.”&nbsp;</p><p>Hintzsche did go to graduate school, earning her master’s and Ph.D. in bioinformatics at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, near Dixon, where she and her family live today. She did her postdoc research in oncology and cancer biology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Denver.&nbsp;</p><p>Hintzsche went from a biology and biochemistry degree at Augustana to becoming&nbsp;NIU’s first Ph.D. graduate in bioinformatics — a program based in computer science — to researching cancer, then applying her scientific, emotional and entrepreneurial skills to the problem of infertility.</p><p>Wegman-Geedey knows many alumni “who are late bloomers.” These are the students who find their footing at Augustana, gain momentum after graduation, and then go on to do great things, the Rock Island private liberal-arts school said.</p><p>“During their undergrad years, the goal is to empower them to be thinkers and dreamers,” Wegman-Geedey said. That empowerment leads to confidence in the doing, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>“What I love about Jenn’s product, the PherDal product, is that she followed that logic that we nudge students to use, even in a research paper. We don’t want them to use these obscure, contrived, really complex concepts. We want them to look at it logically, reduce it down to the common factors, and then consider, ‘What is the next step?’ And that is what she did.”</p><p>For Hintzsche’s journey, Wegman-Geedey said, “It’s not just the science. It’s the ethics, the inquiry, the communication.”</p><p>For more information on PherDal, visit its <a href=#>website HERE.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJiun6WowaK6wGaYpa2dYrWmuM%2BsZLCnpaGxbq7EZqeaqpWjwbR7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2faugustana-alum-helps-would-be-parents.html&text=Augustana%20alum%20helps%20would-be%20parents&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faugustana-alum-helps-would-be-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2faugustana-alum-helps-would-be-parents.html&title=Augustana%20alum%20helps%20would-be%20parents" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2faugustana-alum-helps-would-be-parents.html&title=Augustana%20alum%20helps%20would-be%20parents" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2faugustana-alum-helps-would-be-parents.html&title=Augustana%20alum%20helps%20would-be%20parents" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faugustana-alum-helps-would-be-parents.html&description=Augustana%20alum%20helps%20would-be%20parents" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./eric-buterbaugh-0315.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eric Buterbaugh Floral Designer to Make Fragrances">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./young-belgian-woman-finally-56-star-tattoos-removed-face-year-ordeal-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Young Belgian woman finally has 56 star tattoos removed from her face after four-year ordeal">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

While it may not be as peculiar by current Hollywood standards, it was unprecedented in the past. The duo dated for two years but only married for seven days. Starchuk, a playboy model, was Lee’s first wife, and their short-lived union became the talk of the town.</p><p>Although Starchuk gained attention through her marriage to Lee, she has since pursued a new career as a lashes artist. Here’s a detailed overview of Elaine Starchuk’s life and relationship with the musician.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Elaine-Starchuk-1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Elaine_Starchuk></span>Who Is Elaine Starchuk?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Elaine Starchuk was born on April 4, 1964, in Vancouver, British Colombia, Canada. Born and raised in Canada, little is known about Elaine’s early life, and the former model has kept silent.</p><p>Elaine is a Canadian former model, entrepreneur, and ex-wife of Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee. She is a current resident of Summerland, British Columbia. She has a mesomorph body type, hazel green eyes, and blonde hair. Her zodiac is Aries.</p><p>As a young kid, Elaine wanted to be a model and had breast augmentation surgery done when she was just 16 years old. Despite her enhanced appearance, Elaine didn’t get much attention and decided to move to the United States.</p><p>In 1982, Elaine struggled to make her mark after the move to the States and started working as a model for Playboy Magazine. She posed nude and was featured in several other magazines, including Miss Nude BC and Penthouse.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Elaine_Starchucks_Marriage_and_Divorce></span>Elaine Starchuck’s Marriage and Divorce<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the 1980s, Elaine Starchuk’s seven-day marriage to Tommy Lee, a well-known musician and the band Motley Crue’s drummer, was one such incident that sparked a frenzy in the media.&nbsp;</p><p>Before dating Tommy Lee, Elaine was involved in three other relationships with David Coverdale, Vince Neil, and Gregg Giuffria. She met Tommy during one of his gigs, and the pair began dating soon after. After two years as a couple, Tommy and Elaine tied the knot on November 24, 1984.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Tommy-Lees-first-wife-1.jpg><p>However, their relationship ended quickly, and they ended things just seven days after getting married, finalizing their divorce in May 1985. While no reason has been given for the former couple’s divorce, rumors suggest that Tommy physically assaulted Elaine, leading to their separation.</p><p>Tommy Lee married Todd Marshall after the divorce, but the pair split after four years. Elaine started a relationship with Anders Erikson. They were together for five years before calling things off. Since then, Elaine has not been involved in any relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, Elaine focused on getting her life back on track. She is currently the founder and CEO of Enlightened Lashes and is one of the early pioneers in lashes art in Canada. When she started in 2004, there were only three lash artists in British Columbia.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Tommy_Lee></span>Who Is Tommy Lee?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tommy Lee is an American musician best known as the drummer and co-founder of the heavy metal band Mötley Crüe. He was born on October 3, 1962, in Athens, Greece, but was raised in California.</p><p>Lee formed Mötley Crüe with bassist Nikki Sixx in 1981, and the band became one of the most successful and influential bands of the 1980s and 1990s. They released several multi-platinum albums, including “Shout at the Devil,” “Girls, Girls, Girls,” and “Dr. Feelgood.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tommy-lee.jpg><p>Lee is known for his energetic drumming style and his use of rollercoaster-like drum sets during live performances. He has also released solo albums and collaborated with other musicians, including rapper Ludacris and guitarist Mick Mars.</p><p>Outside of music, Lee has also appeared on reality television shows, including “The Surreal Life,” “Tommy Lee Goes to College,” and “Rock Star: Supernova.” He has been married several times, including to actresses Heather Locklear and Pamela Anderson.</p><p>Lee continues to perform and record music and is considered one of the most influential drummers in rock history. As one of the founding members of the heavy metal band&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mötley Crüe</a>, he has had the pick of girls and has been wed four times.</p><p>Starchuk stayed out of the public eye after her marriage to the drummer ended. But Lee’s other wives are famous <a href=#>celebrities</a> who remain in the spotlight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxKm7jKKqZp2clravsYysq5qqk53CrHnTqKSmsV2hsqa%2FjJ6vZq%2BZm7Jw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-elaine-starchuk-tommy-lees-ex-wife.html&text=Who%20Is%20Elaine%20Starchuk%2c%20Tommy%20Lee%27s%20Ex-Wife%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-elaine-starchuk-tommy-lees-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-elaine-starchuk-tommy-lees-ex-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Elaine%20Starchuk%2c%20Tommy%20Lee%27s%20Ex-Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-elaine-starchuk-tommy-lees-ex-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Elaine%20Starchuk%2c%20Tommy%20Lee%27s%20Ex-Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-elaine-starchuk-tommy-lees-ex-wife.html&title=Who%20Is%20Elaine%20Starchuk%2c%20Tommy%20Lee%27s%20Ex-Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-elaine-starchuk-tommy-lees-ex-wife.html&description=Who%20Is%20Elaine%20Starchuk%2c%20Tommy%20Lee%27s%20Ex-Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./will-riddle-chinas-ancient-wuwangdun-tomb-finally-be-solved.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will riddle of Chinas 2,200-year-old tomb dating back to Warring States Period finally be solved?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./monarch-delay-fox-trace-adkins-susan-sarandon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Trace Adkins' 'Monarch' on Fox Has Been Delayed to Fall">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

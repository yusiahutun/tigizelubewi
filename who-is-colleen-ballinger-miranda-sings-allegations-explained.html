I've never done this with anyone but I'm trusting you."</p><p id=eC-VuIUH3l2 data-wc=50>Colleen went on to <strong>give Adam access to the official Miranda Sings Twitter account,&nbsp;</strong>and considered him her "social media intern," though after a slew of posts faced backlash, he alleges she cut him off, bad-mouthed him, and cost him the community of friends he had created via the fandom.</p><p id=eDKfFz_SLNA data-wc=54>He has since shared several more videos this month detailing his relationship with Colleen. In one particularly problematic allegation, he recounts the time <strong>he was 15 and Colleen was 31, and they planned to spend the day together,</strong> though the meeting only lasted a few minutes after Colleen became unresponsive and unkind towards him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a468b7128848-gettyimages-1471342241.jpg><h2 dir=ltr><strong>What was Colleen Ballinger's first apology?</strong></h2><p id=eTxNQujmMBWG data-wc=68>In a May 2020 video titled "<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>addressing everything</a>," Colleen responded to a slew of allegations, <strong>including Adam's claim that she sent him a pair of her underwear.</strong> She said: "No, I should have never sent a fan underwear, how stupid am I? No, I definitely should have never given him access to my Twitter account, and no, I shouldn't have talked to him as often as I did."</p><p id=elxfLOXd6sun data-wc=48>She also apologized for a racist video mocking Latina women, for making a fatphobic comment about a woman on an airplane, and addressed a now-viral video <strong>where she jokes about abusing her childhood dog</strong>, who in turn bit her, which led her family to subsequently put him down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5e939fbd6815-gettyimages-476643568.jpg><h2 dir=ltr><strong>What are the new allegations against Colleen Ballinger?</strong></h2><p id=eq9EY953wiBU data-wc=50>New and old allegations against Colleen resurfaced this month after Kodee Tyler Dahl's since-deleted YouTube video titled <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>“why I left the colleen ballinger fandom …</a>," where they explained that they were going to share their own follow-up to Adam's 2020 video about the drama before Colleen asked them not to.</p><p id=ecszDCVIpMfB data-wc=58>In their video, they exposed a Twitter group chat between Colleen and her closest fans titled <strong>"colleeny's weenies group chat,"</strong> screenshots of which allegedly see the YouTuber making inappropriate comments and questions to the members – many of them were minors – such as about their virginity, their favorite sex positions, and "trauma dumping" about her personal life.</p><p id=e3U9jfLCvzmG data-wc=60>Colleen as Miranda Sings has also received her fair share of backlash over similar instances. On June 6, a fan with the social media tag @notitsbecks detailed her experience at a 2019 Miranda Sings show, where she was brought up on stage by "Miranda" and has since <strong>claimed she was "exploited" on stage when she was put in exposing positions.</strong></p><p id=eoIoO_w-VnDZ data-wc=54>Other similar instances have been brought to light, such as her asking a nine-year-old to reach into her pants for a "snack" from the bag of cheese balls she would stuff in them while on stage, and slut-shaming a 14-year-old (when she was in her 30s) over her outfit for a Miranda Sings show.</p><p id=e_07JNZEKv data-wc=50>i’ve been debating posting this picture, but this was me on stage. she encouraged her fans to wear revealing clothing so we would get called on stage. and then she exploited us and our bodies for her own gain. so yeah, i’m okay with calling her a predator. <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/uQRHsi9zD7</a> <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/8CWZtoN8cw</a></p>— becky (@noitsbecks) <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>June 10, 2023</a><h2 dir=ltr><strong>What did Colleen Ballinger say in her apology video?</strong></h2><p id=e_DVsy5nFS6G data-wc=30>Colleen released a new apology video on June 28 titled <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>“hi,”</a> <strong>where she denied most of the grooming allegations and beyond,</strong> through a ten minute song performed with a ukulele.</p><p id=e2-F9gaQV6Jx data-wc=49>In it, she accuses Internet users of encouraging the "toxic gossip train, chugging down the tracks of misinformation," and though she admits to messaging her fans often, she says it was done in a "loser" way and that:<strong>&nbsp;"The only thing I’ve ever groomed is my two Persian cats."</strong></p><p id=es6Ds1i2lX6O data-wc=40>She maintained: "I know that you wanted me to say that I was 100 percent in the wrong/ Well, I'm sorry I'm not going to take that route of admitting to lies and rumors that you made up for clout."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dYWVb2pyZ6edvG610maaqKScmrKvecGao6Whnpyys3nMoqmappSWerS1zaCqZpmcobKordOipqerXZrFsbjAoqWenF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-colleen-ballinger-miranda-sings-allegations-explained.html&text=Who%20is%20Colleen%20Ballinger%20and%20what%20is%20she%20being%20accused%20of%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-colleen-ballinger-miranda-sings-allegations-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-colleen-ballinger-miranda-sings-allegations-explained.html&title=Who%20is%20Colleen%20Ballinger%20and%20what%20is%20she%20being%20accused%20of%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-colleen-ballinger-miranda-sings-allegations-explained.html&title=Who%20is%20Colleen%20Ballinger%20and%20what%20is%20she%20being%20accused%20of%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-colleen-ballinger-miranda-sings-allegations-explained.html&title=Who%20is%20Colleen%20Ballinger%20and%20what%20is%20she%20being%20accused%20of%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-colleen-ballinger-miranda-sings-allegations-explained.html&description=Who%20is%20Colleen%20Ballinger%20and%20what%20is%20she%20being%20accused%20of%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-suicide-squad-cast-john-cenas-package-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'The Suicide Squad' Cast Has Thoughts on John Cena's Package">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gordon-ramsays-maze-grill-hong-kong-aims-high-and-hits.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="We review Gordon Ramsays new Maze Grill in Hong Kong and it hit all the right spots">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

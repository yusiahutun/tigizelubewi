He continued to work steadily in the decades that followed, often excelling with dramedies and movies that dealt with relationships, though he also proved himself unafraid to experiment outside such genres, making for an overall diverse filmography. It's worth noting that his skills went beyond the world of cinema, too, as he's one of the <a href=#>few people to have an EGOT</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But to stay focused on the movie side of things, he made a total of 20 films in a career that lasted just over 40 years, though admittedly, one was a TV movie, and another within that 20 counts as a miniseries. Still, all these are worth exploring and discussing because he was one of his generation's most interesting and distinctive filmmakers, and his influence on American cinema continues to be felt to this day.</p><h2 id=39-what-planet-are-you-from-39-2000><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>'What Planet Are You From?'

It's certainly interesting that something like this exists within Nichols's body of work, but it doesn't truly demonstrate his skills as a filmmaker.</p><h2 id=39-the-day-of-the-dolphin-39-1973><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>'The Day of the Dolphin' (1973)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-day-of-the-dolphin-1973.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of offbeat and unusual Mike Nichols movies, the filmmaker was also behind <strong>The Day of the Dolphin</strong>, which came out many years before What Planet Are You From? while also being classifiable as sci-fi. It's about highly-trained dolphins being stolen and potentially used to carry out an assassination mission. Also, the dolphins have a limited ability to understand and speak English.</p><p>Things get even wilder when considering that the lead character - a dolphin trainer - is played by the scenery-chewing <strong>George C. Scott</strong>, just a few years on from his Oscar win for <strong>Patton</strong>. It might all be bizarre enough to prove compelling for certain viewers, but most people would probably be better off not giving The Day of the Dolphin the time of day.</p><h2 id=39-the-fortune-39-1975><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>'The Fortune' (1975)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-fortune-1975.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On paper, <strong>The Fortune</strong> sounds like it has the potential to be <a href=#>a genuinely classic crime movie</a>. It stars <strong>Warren Beatty</strong> and <strong>Jack Nicholson</strong>, who were two of the biggest and best actors of their generation, has a 1920s setting, and tells a farcical story involving a pair of con men trying in vain to scam an heiress and obtain her fortune.</p><p>Regrettably, there's a good reason why the film isn't particularly well known, despite the popularity of its director and stars: it's simply not very good. It all feels half-hearted and distressingly by the numbers at best, making for a comedic crime movie that's neither particularly funny as a comedy, nor engaging/intense as a crime film.</p><h2 id=39-regarding-henry-39-1991><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>'Regarding Henry' (1991)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/regarding-henry-1991.jpg><p><strong>Regarding Henry</strong> certainly isn't terrible, and it's fair to say that it's a movie that gets off to a decent enough start. It stars <strong>Harrison Ford</strong> as a man who survives getting shot in an armed robbery, only to find the incident drastically impacts his memory and personality, with the film following him as he tries to readjust to life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ford's alright in what would've been a challenging role to play, and though <strong>Annette Bening's</strong> character (she plays the title character's wife) isn't amazingly well-written, she still gives a good performance. Regarding Henry's ultimately let down, however, by a second half that drowns its characters in needlessly contrived melodrama, which sort of squanders the more grounded approach of the film's superior first half.</p><h2 id=39-wolf-39-1994><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>'Wolf' (1994)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/wolf-1994.jpg><p>Despite coming out <a href=#>the same year as <strong>Pulp Fiction</strong></a>, <strong>Wolf </strong>is most certainly not a spin-off of that film focused on the character of Winston Wolf (<strong>Harvey Keitel</strong>).

Furthermore, Wil grew up with his two siblings, elder brother, <strong>Christian Trapp</strong>, and sister, <strong>Julia Trapp</strong>.</p><p>Talking about his educational and early sporting career, Trapp attended Lincoln High School. Although Wil played just two years with the high school, his performances were so impressive that Lincoln High School decided to retire his jersey number 20 in 2014.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erling Haaland Bio: Stats, Father, Goals, Contract, TransferMarkt Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Most notably, the 27-year-old was an All-American in both those years while also leading the team to their first-ever state title in 2009.</p><p>Thereafter, Trapp spent some time at the U.S Soccer Development Academy and then attended the University of Akron in 2011.</p><p>Like in high school, Wil helped his college team win three MAC titles, two regular-season tournaments and qualified in the NCAA Tournament in both of his years with the Akron Zips.</p><p>Thus, after only two years with the University of Akron, Trapp decided to turn professional at the end of 2012.</p><h2>Wil Trapp: Career</h2><p>Trapp began his professional career with hometown club Columbus Crew as a homegrown player. The Ohio native made a stunning debut against Portland Timbers in a 1-0 victory.</p><p>As a result, Wil bagged the man of the match award, which made his debut one to remember.</p><p>After that, he played another fifteen games for the club that season before earning the club’s Breakout Performer of the Year award.</p><p>Consequently, Columbus rewarded the youngster with the vice-captain’s responsibility for the following season.</p><p>Subsequently, the then 21-year-old broke many records in his second professional season. To illustrate, Trapp became the youngest player in MLS history to captain a team at just 21 years and 122 days.</p><p>In doing so, Will became the first Homegrown Player in the league’s history to hold the captain’s armband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/trapp-1240.jpg><p>Besides, the 5 feet 8 midfielders scored his first professional goal against Houston Dynamo in a 2-2 draw on September 12, 2014.</p><p>Hence, after having a fantastic second season, Wil had high expectations to step up his game even further.</p><p>On the contrary, the U.S international suffered from various injuries in the 2015 season. As a consequence, Trapp missed a lot of games, which subsequently hampered his form. Nonetheless, the Ohio native managed to appear in 25 games, assisting one time.</p><p>However, the business was back to normal in the 2016 season as Wil earned his first MLS All-Start call-up.</p><p>In doing so, Trapp became the first-ever Homegrown Player in Columbus’ history to be named as an All-Star. Subsequently, Crews SC offered Trapp a contract extension, which he duly signed, that would keep him at the club till the 2020 season.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giovanni Reyna Bio: England, Career, Father, Age, Salary, Net Worth Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>The following year, Trapp received probably the best achievement of his career to date when he got handed the captain’s armband in 2017.</p><p>As a result, the pressure was on the Ohio native to lead his team to better performances. And that is precisely what Wil did as he played in career-high 40 games.</p><p>The 5 feet 8 midfielders also bagged career-high five assists and three MLS team of the week nods in the process.</p><p>All in all, the 2017 year turned out to be very good for Wil on a personal level. After that, in 2018, Trapp remained captain of the team, helping them finish in the playoff spots.</p><p>Additionally, he also scored the second goal of his career in a 3-2 victory against Orlando City.</p><p>In fact, his near forty-yard strike was so impressive that it won the MLS Goal of the Week. After that, the U.S international spent another season with the Crews before moving to a new chapter in his career.</p><p>Nevertheless, by the time he finished his stint with Columbus, Wil had played in 205 games scoring two goals and providing 13 assists.</p><p>Thus, after seven years of service for his hometown club, Trapp got traded to the newly formed Inter Miami CF owned by footballing royalty, <a href=#><strong>David Beckham</strong></a>.</p><p>As of now, only two games have been played in the MLS due to the world pandemic of Corona Virus (COVID-19), which has forced the league to be postponed until further notice.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have full faith in Trapp and his new club Inter Miami to perform very well once the season re-starts.</p><h2>Wil Trapp: Age, Height & Nationality</h2><p>Wil was born in the year 1993, which makes him 27 years old currently. Likewise, he&nbsp;celebrates his birthday on the 15th of January, which makes his horoscope,&nbsp;Capricorn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/wil-trapp-height.3-168x300.jpg><p>And, talking about his nationality, Trapp was born in Ohio, which makes him American by nationality.</p><p>Furthermore, the Columbus midfielder stands at 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 meters) and weighs 68 kg.</p><p>Although Wil’s height is quite small for an American, he does not let it affect his gameplay. As a matter of fact, Trapp uses his short stature to change directions and pass to his open teammates quickly.</p><h2>Wil Trapp: Net Worth & Salary</h2><p>As of 2020, Trapp has a net worth of <strong>$1.5 million</strong> accrued mainly through his MLS playing career. Likewise, this is my seventh year as a professional for the U.S international. Hence, his net worth should come as no surprise.</p><h4><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brek Shea Bio: Salary, Career, Atlanta United, TransferMarkt, Wife Wiki >></a></strong></h4><p>Furthermore, Wil is currently making <strong>$593,000</strong> <strong>per year</strong> with the Columbus Crew. Moreover, <i>Trapp</i>&nbsp;has earned over<strong> $2.1 million</strong> on salaries alone throughout his seven-year tenure in the MLS.</p><p>However, we believe that Wil’s big payday is still to come as he is yet to reach his potential.</p><h3>Wil Trapp: Trade (Transfer)</h3><p>Back on January 31, 2020, Columbus Crews traded Wil Trapp to Inter Miami CF. In turn, Inter received an international roster spot and <strong>$100,000</strong> in General Allocation Money.</p><h2>Wil Trapp: Wife & Kids</h2><p>Talking about his personal life, Wil is in a loving relationship with his wife, <strong>Beth Trapp</strong>. Moreover, the couple got married back in 2016 and celebrated their anniversary on the 17th of December.</p><p>Since then, the two have seen their love grow with each passing day with no signs of controversy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/wil-trapp-wife-and-kid.2-260x300.png><p>In fact, the couple further solidified their marriage with the arrival of their son, <strong>Mijo Trapp</strong>, on October 20, 2019. Furthermore, the family of three is delighted, as suggested by Wil’s various posts on Instagram.</p><h2>Social Media</h2><p><a href=#>Instagram</a>: 24.5k followers</p><h2>Will Trapp | FAQs</h2><h3>Which squad number does Wil Trapp feature in?</h3><p>At present, Wil Trapp features number 29 for the Minnesota United FC. He has also been number 6 for Inter Miami FC and Columbus Crew SC. Not to mention, he was also number 20 and 29 for the Columbus Crew.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDDyKVkraqRpb1ursioZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwil-trapp-bio.html&text=Wil%20Trapp%20Bio%20%5b2023%20Update%5d%20%3a%20Career%2c%20Transfer%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwil-trapp-bio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwil-trapp-bio.html&title=Wil%20Trapp%20Bio%20%5b2023%20Update%5d%20%3a%20Career%2c%20Transfer%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwil-trapp-bio.html&title=Wil%20Trapp%20Bio%20%5b2023%20Update%5d%20%3a%20Career%2c%20Transfer%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwil-trapp-bio.html&title=Wil%20Trapp%20Bio%20%5b2023%20Update%5d%20%3a%20Career%2c%20Transfer%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwil-trapp-bio.html&description=Wil%20Trapp%20Bio%20%5b2023%20Update%5d%20%3a%20Career%2c%20Transfer%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tips-to-get-remote-job-no-experience.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="8 Tips on Getting a Remote Job With No Work Experience">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sunny-anderson-married-husband-divorce-boyfriend-net-worth-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sunny Anderson Married, Husband, Divorce, Boyfriend, Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

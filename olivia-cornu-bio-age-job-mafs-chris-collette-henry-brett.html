Below you’ll learn about her job, age, and her previous relationships.</p><p>So, keep on scrolling down this article to learn more about her.</p><h3><strong>MAFS: Olivia Cornu And Brett Lindsey</strong></h3><p>When love experts matched Olivia Cornu and Brett Lindsey, fans weren’t sure they were a perfect match for each other. But why?</p><p>Many viewers voiced that Brett didn’t seem serious about getting “married at first sight”. Most of them felt sorry for Olivia, although she also appeared inflexible and unwilling to compromise in the relationship. However, what made it even worse was when Brett asked Olivia’s sister if she was single, which was a red flag and no doubt a deal-breaker. So, Olivia was clearly not wrong to boldly announce that she didn’t trust Brett on the 30 September 2021 episode.</p><p>The womanizer persona is certainly intolerable and was a turn-off for Olivia and fans of the show.</p><p>However, Brett wasn’t the only one to blame. When he wished for kisses and cuddles Olivia denied it because she wasn’t into PDA and she wasn’t going to change all of a sudden for him. They also couldn’t find a middle ground about having children. Olivia shared that she came to a realization that she wanted to marry someone who didn’t want children and who was “into her for her.”</p><p>What viewers hated most about Brett was his mean remarks toward the woman he is planning to spend the rest of his life with. Plus, he didn’t feel sorry for his misdemeanor. He also demonstrated a sense of insecurity upon learning that Olivia made more than him as a nurse practitioner.</p><p>But, both of them played an equal part in the failure of the relationship. Plus they never got the opportunity to explore each other physically on the show. Olivia announced that she knew it was never going to happen.</p><p>Fans of the show even noted that the pair reminded them of season 10 couple, Zach and Mindy, from the very beginning.</p><p>Part of the viewers blamed Brett for his arrogance, self-nature, and poor communication skills. The other half blamed experts for putting together an unlikely couple who weren’t compatible with each other despite both hailed from Louisiana.</p><h3><strong>MAFS: Olivia Cornu And Henry Rodriguez</strong></h3><p>Olivia Cornu and Henry Rodriguez both failed to find love on MAFS in season 11 of the show. But, the pair forged a friendship after the show. Henry was matched with Christina Crochet. And like, Olivia and Brett, their personality didn’t match though experts had hoped that their polarizing personalities would help them bring the best out of one another.</p><p>Henry turned out to be too calm for Christina who confronted the former for his laid-back personality to the point that she demanded to know if he was even interested in her. Henry approved of their marriage and expressed his satisfaction but Christina chose arguments on several occasions.</p><p>On decision day Olivia was single, and fans argued that Olivia and Henry would’ve been a better match. But social media activity showed that they were in touch with each other after the show. They even went for a night out together at Zocalo Cocona Mexicana & Cantina. One of the pictures from the night was a “couple-like” selfie of Olivia with Henry that stirred conversation.</p><p>Olivia sweetly rested her head on Henry’s shoulder as they beamed for the camera. It’s clear that the pair is comfortable with each other’s company. So, fans wondered if they were an item now.</p><p>Addressing the rumor Henry said that he and Olivia Cornu are not together, but he wouldn’t rule it out.</p><p>But, Henry found love with his new girlfriend Kayla McCormick. They made their relationship official on 4 July while posting photos of them in formal attire, including affectionate photos of the two in a photo booth. Henry captioned the post, “Red, white, and boo.”</p><h3><strong>Is Olivia Cornu Dating Married At First Sight Alum Chris Collette?</strong></h3><p>MAFS’s <a href=#>Chris Collette</a> confirmed that he was dating someone after the MAFS marriage and fans assume that it was Olivia Cornu.</p><p>Chris was paired with <a href=#>Alyssa Ellman</a> in season 14 of the show. They disagreed on many things including shared apartments and spending time with him. The pair ended their marriage.</p><p>As it turned out on the night of their wedding, Alyssa pointed out that the two of them lacked compatibility and had “too many differences”. Their 12 days of marriage ended and since Chris announced a sprouting new relationship, Reality Titbits reached out to Olivia for comments on the rumor.</p><p>Olivia shared, “Unfortunately, I’m not allowed to talk until after the episode, but I will say we are both happy”. Since Chris resides in Holden, Massachusetts and Olivia is a New Orleans native, the distance between them makes it unlikely that they are seeing each other although fans strongly feel they are a new couple.</p><h3><strong>Olivia Cornu Age</strong></h3><p>In December 2021, Olivia Cornu turned 32 years old.</p><h3><strong>Olivia Cornu Job</strong></h3><p>Per LinkedIn, Olivia Cornu is a nurse practitioner at Tulane University School of Medicine since June 2017. She is also working as an RN at the University of Iowa Hospital and The University of Iowa Health Care. She had previously served as neuro-interventional surgery — advanced registered nurse practitioner at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinic.</p><p>From 2012 to 2013, Olivia worked at LSU Health Sciences Center.</p><p>Olivia holds B.Sc in Nursing from Northwestern State University and a Masters’s degree in Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner from the University of Cinncinati.</p><h3><strong>Is Olivia Cornu On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Indeed, Olivia Cornu is on Instagram. Click the <a href=#>link</a> to find her.</p><h3><strong>Olivia Cornu Family</strong></h3><p>Olivia Cornu was born to her mother Trish Nattin. Trish turned 59 years old in January 2022. We believe that her father is Sterling Cornu, the current resident of <span class=nc684nl6>Frankfort, Kentucky.</span></p><p>Olivia’s parents are no longer together but her mother is currently married to her husband Rodney Nattin Jr. Her elder sister is Sarah Cornu Robin who turned 37 years old in August 2021. Her father has also moved on and shared a picture of his new partner on his FB.</p><p>Sarah is a graduate of Parkway High School. She completed college at <span class=nc684nl6>Louisiana Tech University</span> and <span class=nc684nl6>Northwestern State University. She is currently working as a Teacher-Librarian at Curtis Elementary at Bossier Parish Schools.</span></p><p><span class=nc684nl6>Sarah and her husband share two sons.</span></p><p>Moreover, Olivia also has a grandmother who turned 93 in May 2022.</p><h3><strong>Olivia Cornu Height</strong></h3><p>Olivia Cornu’s height measures under 5 feet 6.5 inches.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Olivia Cornu Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Olivia Cornu celebrates her birthday on 7 December.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Olivia Cornu From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Olivia Cornu hailed from <span class=nc684nl6>Bossier City, Louisiana.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmqKSZq7aiecKoqaetXZe2sHnAoJxmop%2BXeq6txaxknKCinsBur86lo56spJp6qbHNq7BmmqKawbV7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2folivia-cornu-bio-age-job-mafs-chris-collette-henry-brett.html&text=Meet%20MAFS%20Alum%20Olivia%20Cornu%21%20Her%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Job%2c%20MAFS%2c%20Chris%20Collette&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2folivia-cornu-bio-age-job-mafs-chris-collette-henry-brett.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2folivia-cornu-bio-age-job-mafs-chris-collette-henry-brett.html&title=Meet%20MAFS%20Alum%20Olivia%20Cornu%21%20Her%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Job%2c%20MAFS%2c%20Chris%20Collette" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2folivia-cornu-bio-age-job-mafs-chris-collette-henry-brett.html&title=Meet%20MAFS%20Alum%20Olivia%20Cornu%21%20Her%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Job%2c%20MAFS%2c%20Chris%20Collette" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2folivia-cornu-bio-age-job-mafs-chris-collette-henry-brett.html&title=Meet%20MAFS%20Alum%20Olivia%20Cornu%21%20Her%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Job%2c%20MAFS%2c%20Chris%20Collette" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2folivia-cornu-bio-age-job-mafs-chris-collette-henry-brett.html&description=Meet%20MAFS%20Alum%20Olivia%20Cornu%21%20Her%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Job%2c%20MAFS%2c%20Chris%20Collette" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tommie-amber-pirie.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Tommie-Amber Pirie dating?

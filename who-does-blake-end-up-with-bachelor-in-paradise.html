Blake was originally a contestant on The Bachelorette Season 16 with Clare Crawley and Tayshia Adams, where he was sent home before Hometown Dates. He was then a contestant on The Bachelorette Season 17 with Katie Thurston, where he was the winner and got engaged to Katie at the Final Rose Ceremony. Katie and Blake broke up soon after The Bachelorette Season 17 finale aired. The breakup made Blake single and available for Bachelor in Paradise Season 9, where he dated Jess Girod, a contestant from The Bachelor Season 27 with Zach Shallcross.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> is a spinoff of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Bachelor</a> franchise premiered on ABC in March 2002 with businessman Alex Michel as the first Bachelor. The show has since aired for more than 27 seasons and produced several spin-offs including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Bachelorette</a>,<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> Bachelor in Paradise</a>, Bachelor Pad, The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart, and The Bachelor Winter Games.&nbsp;</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a> premiered in August 2014 as a reality TV dating series featuring former contestants from The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. The show starts with an uneven number of women and men from The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. Each week, there’s a Rose Ceremony where either the men or women give roses to the contestants they feel the strongest connection to. The contestants who don’t receive a rose are sent home.</p><p>The next week, the roles are reversed, and the gender that didn’t give out roses the previous week now chooses who to give a rose to and who to send home. Each week, more contestants from past seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette join the show to create an uneven number between the women and men and force the contestants already there to either couple up with someone new or stay in their current relationship. Contestants are also given date cards at random to choose contestants they want to spend alone time with. Many new contestants join the show with a date card.</p><p>At the end of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Bachelor in Paradise</a>, the contestants are offered an opportunity to have an overnight date with no cameras or microphones (much like Fantasy Suites on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette.) After the overnight dates is the finale, where contestants either choose to break up or get engaged. Like The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, Bachelor in Paradise also has an “After the Final Rose” special, where contestants reunite to hash out drama and update viewers on their relationship.</p><p>But back to Blake on Bachelor in Paradise. So… <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>who does Blake end up with on Bachelor in Paradise</a> Season 9 and does he get engaged in the BIP Season 9 finale? Read on for what happens to Blake on Bachelor in Paradise and if he’s back together with Katie.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=16.5><h2>Who does Blake end up with on Bachelor in Paradise Season 9?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Blake-Bachelor-in-Paradise-2023.jpg><p>Who does Blake end up with on Bachelor in Paradise 2023? The answer is no one. Blake Moynes (The Bachelorette Season 16 and 17) leaves Bachelor in Paradise Season 9 single, according to Reality Steve.</p><p>Reality Steve reported that Blake self-eliminated on Bachelor in Paradise Season 9 after his ex-fiance, Katie Thurston, who he got engaged to on The Bachelorette Season 17, appears on Bachelor in Paradise Season 9 to talk to him. Before he self-eliminated, Blake also broke up with Jess Girod, who was on The Bachelor Season 27 with Zach Shallcross and was in a couple with Blake since the start of Bachelor in Paradise Season 9, according to Reality Steve.</p><p>In an Instagram Story in August 2023, Katie confirmed that, when she filmed Bachelor in Paradise Season 9, it had been more than a year since the last time she saw Blake. “first time seeing/speaking since we split 1.5 years ago. Can’t say much more for now,” she wrote.</p><p>Katie also confirmed in a response to a fan in another Instagram Story at the time that she did not appear on Bachelor in Paradise to “get closure” with Blake. “Spoiler alert: I was NOT invited to get closure,” she wrote.</p><p>Katie, who stars on FBoy Island Season 30, also told Us Weekly at the time about why she and Blake broke up after The Bachelorette Season 17. “We lived in different countries during the pandemic. I think we were just already up against a lot,” Katie said. “So you just got to find someone who’s willing to put in the work. And that’s not even to him or myself. It’s just in general, long-distance is hard and maybe not the right choice for someone like me who really wants a hands-on, in-person relationship.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9><h2>Who's Blake from Bachelor in Paradise Season 9?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/blake-moynes-bachelorette-2021-1.jpg><p>Who is Blake from Bachelor in Paradise 2023? Blake Moynes is a 33-year-old Wildlife Manager from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. He was a contestant on The Bachelorette Season 16 with Clare Crawley and Tayshia Adams, and The Bachelorette Season 17 with Katie Thurston, which he won. He was sent home in eighth place on The Bachelorette Season 16. Katie and Blake broke up and ended their engagement less than a year after their finale. Read Blake’s biography for The Bachelorette Season 16 ahead:</p><p>“Blake Moynes is no stranger to putting in the hard work to get what he wants in life. At university, he studied every kind of wildlife management program he could get his hands on and now spends his days happily working outdoors. Professionally, Blake Moynes says he has it all, but personally, he is at a crossroad. In the past, Blake spent his Saturday nights hanging with his best friends, but now all of those friends are married and he’s the last single man remaining. Not one to like being left out, Blake Moynes now feels the pressure to settle down and wife up! His dream woman is outdoorsy, beautiful and fun. She has to have a goofy side and be okay with his self-described “potty mouth”. He says he has no problems talking about his emotions and wants a partner who will appreciate that he wears his heart on his sleeve. Blake Moynes is confident that Clare Crawley is the woman for him, and when this is all over, he can’t wait to take her home with him to meet all of his friends.”</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfrLWwecOonKxlkqGurLGMnqWdZaWleri106Fkm5mTnbKtu9FmoKdloJa%2ForDIrJxo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-does-blake-end-up-with-bachelor-in-paradise.html&text=Who%20Does%20Blake%20End%20Up%20With%20on%20Bachelor%20in%20Paradise%202023%3f%20Is%20Katie%20Back%20Together%20With%20Him%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-does-blake-end-up-with-bachelor-in-paradise.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-does-blake-end-up-with-bachelor-in-paradise.html&title=Who%20Does%20Blake%20End%20Up%20With%20on%20Bachelor%20in%20Paradise%202023%3f%20Is%20Katie%20Back%20Together%20With%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-does-blake-end-up-with-bachelor-in-paradise.html&title=Who%20Does%20Blake%20End%20Up%20With%20on%20Bachelor%20in%20Paradise%202023%3f%20Is%20Katie%20Back%20Together%20With%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-does-blake-end-up-with-bachelor-in-paradise.html&title=Who%20Does%20Blake%20End%20Up%20With%20on%20Bachelor%20in%20Paradise%202023%3f%20Is%20Katie%20Back%20Together%20With%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-does-blake-end-up-with-bachelor-in-paradise.html&description=Who%20Does%20Blake%20End%20Up%20With%20on%20Bachelor%20in%20Paradise%202023%3f%20Is%20Katie%20Back%20Together%20With%20Him%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fai-mcnasty.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Fai McNasty dating?

According to Judd, the boy was staying with his grandfather to "help him out" while his grandmother was in rehab; his father, the suspect, had "no place else to go" and showed up "about a month ago."</p><p>On Monday, the grandfather went to visit his wife and returned home to find his son in front of his Lake Wales mobile home. Rodda allegedly told his father, "I wouldn't go in there if I was you. I killed someone. You may need to call the police."</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here are photos of 16 year old Stephen Lee Rodda, provided to PCSO from the family. Stephen is standing in the middle of his brothers and sister. His brothersâ€™ names are Matthew and Logan, and his sisterâ€™s name is Elizabeth. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4kam6olIYv</a></p>â€” Polk County Sheriff ðŸš” Grady Judd (@PolkCoSheriff) <a href=#>September 4, 2023</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>@PolkCoSheriff</a><p>While the grandfather told police "it was not uncommon for his son to talk bizarre" considering &nbsp;his alleged history of methamphetamine use and psychotic episodes, he went inside the home and found his grandson dead in the dining room. Police believe an angle grinder, or "pretty heavy duty saw," was used to kill the teen.</p><p>Though Rodda "fled the scene" after talking to his father, said Judd, he was apprehended about a mile away. "When we took him into custody, he told our deputy, 'You probably want to read me my rights,'" said Judd, "and that's exactly what we did."</p><p>"It breaks our heart. There aren't adequate words to explain how horrific this event is," said Judd. "To have this worthless individual murder his son is inexplicable."</p><p>"We don't know yet why Stephen Thomas Rodda attacked and murdered his son," Judd continued, saying that while Rodda's family said he had a history of substance use, they don't know whether he was on drugs when he allegedly killed his son. "The world lost a great young man today and we've got an evil, evil man in custody and we're gonna do our best to see he spends the rest of his life in prison," he continued.</p><p>Authorities also said Rodda recently spent time in South Carolina, Washington DC, Ohio and Texas -- and even had an outstanding warrant for his arrest in South Carolina. Judd said he had a criminal history all over the United States, saying, "This guy has been nothing but a problem to society for a very long time."</p><p>"We don't know why he did what he did today, other than he's a nasty, nasty, evil person," he continued.</p><p>Speaking about the victim, Judd said the teenager was studying to be an electrician and was set to start work at Burger King next week to earn money to buy a car. He was in the 11th grade and remembered by his family as a "great kid."</p><p>"He was just a standup, stellar young man," he said, adding that his family is just "devastated," "heartbroken" and "don't understand" why he was murdered. "The family is just in absolute total shock," he concluded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3JmaW1fqMGmvMeepWasmKS6or%2BMq6adnJFiura%2Bw56pZqufo3qxu9aeqWasn6S5cA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fstephen-thomas-rodda-murder-son-power-tool.html&text=Florida%20Man%20Arrested%20For%20Murder%20Of%2016-Year-Old%20Son%20With%20Power%20Tool&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstephen-thomas-rodda-murder-son-power-tool.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstephen-thomas-rodda-murder-son-power-tool.html&title=Florida%20Man%20Arrested%20For%20Murder%20Of%2016-Year-Old%20Son%20With%20Power%20Tool" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fstephen-thomas-rodda-murder-son-power-tool.html&title=Florida%20Man%20Arrested%20For%20Murder%20Of%2016-Year-Old%20Son%20With%20Power%20Tool" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fstephen-thomas-rodda-murder-son-power-tool.html&title=Florida%20Man%20Arrested%20For%20Murder%20Of%2016-Year-Old%20Son%20With%20Power%20Tool" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstephen-thomas-rodda-murder-son-power-tool.html&description=Florida%20Man%20Arrested%20For%20Murder%20Of%2016-Year-Old%20Son%20With%20Power%20Tool" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./gisele-bundchen-sheer-high-low-dress-barefoot-woods-gaia-herbs-8369154.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gisele Bndchen Wore a Sheer High-Low Dress While Walking Barefoot in the Woods">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./andy-cohen-bravo-stars-death-rhoc-alum-lauri-peterson-son-joshua-waring.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Andy Cohen, Bravo Stars Mourn Death of RHOC Alum Lauri Peterson's Son Joshua Waring at 35">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

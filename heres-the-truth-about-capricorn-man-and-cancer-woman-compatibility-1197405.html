Capricorn men are drawn to the emotionality and intuition of Cancer women. At the same time, Cancer fosters and prods the closed-off Capricorn to open up. Capricorns, who are Earth signs, find harmony with Water signs like Cancer. Both Capricorns and Cancers are devoted, therefore they are compatible in a committed partnership.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><strong>Friendship and Understanding</strong></p><p>Cancer is a cardinal water sign, and as such, they have a highly intuitive temperament and are very good readers of Capricorn. Given that Capricorn tends to be a little too reserved at times, this might be a tremendous asset in their friendship. Capricorns are also cardinal signs, therefore they both wish to be in command and bring about change, according to the zodiac birth chart. Additionally, they share a similar work ethic, so they will admire each other's determination to succeed.</p><p><strong>Intimacy</strong></p><p>Sexual intimacy between Cancer and Capricorn is brilliant. They are assigned opposite signs, which explains why. They will both have tremendous sexual desire and a deep bond because of their opposing signs. Any time they are both connected, the passion will come to the surface. The chemistry continues and grows stronger in the bedroom. Cancer, however, is hesitant to come out of their emotional shell. Capricorn, meanwhile, is aware of their cravings. Capricorn possesses the gods' forbearance, which is a blessing. They permit Cancer to progress slowly. While Cancer goes about letting rid of one inhibition after another, they wait. From the depths of their emotions, they will help their partner. This couple will eventually experience the ecstasy of sexual emancipation.</p><p><img alt="Capricorn an earth sign" title="Capricorn an earth sign" width=1080 height=1080 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2022-11/1667476422_10.jpg></p><p><strong>Areas of Conflict</strong></p><p>The emotional aspect that is characteristic of Cancerians can be both a strength and a weakness in their partnership with Capricorn. On the one hand, Cancer's compassion helps ease Capricorn's occasionally anxious soul. On the other hand, a Capricorn may occasionally find it difficult to handle a Cancer's mood swings. Communication is one of the most crucial factors to keep in mind when trying to build a long-lasting connection between these two sun signs.</p><p>Communication to get over their differences is essential for these two signs to have a strong friendship. They will be able to overcome any hurdle if they can learn to communicate with each other honestly and openly.</p><p><strong>Marriage</strong></p><p>The Capricorn male and the Cancer female are wonderful companions because of their many similarities.

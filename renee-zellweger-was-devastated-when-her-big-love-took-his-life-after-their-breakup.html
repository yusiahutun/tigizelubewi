Gradually establishing a presence in the early 1990s through movies like Dazed And Confused, she later went on to become a <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star thanks to parts in big hitters like Jerry Maguire, later leading the Bridget Jones’s Diary series that established her without any doubt as a bankable lead. From Chicago to Judy, she has starred in a range of acclaimed efforts over the years, even winning the <a href=#>Oscar</a> for Best Actress for her portrayal of Judy Garland in the 2019 biopic.

However, the couple stayed together for around five years before she broke things off.</p><p>Tragically, roughly two years after their relationship ended, Sims took his own life on June 6th 1995, at the age of 28.</p><p>“His death wasn’t very long after [they broke up],’ Sims’ mother Bonnie told the Daily Mail in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>.</p><p>“[Renée] was moving to Florida, and he wasn’t. Doctors say that when you’re already mentally ill, there are triggering events – you’re depressed already, and then something terrible happens that makes you more depressed.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-renee-spoke-at-sims-funeral-and-continues-to-pay-tribute>Renée spoke at Sims’ funeral and continues to pay tribute</h2><p>Sims was suffering from a major depression in the years following his break-up with Renée, and sadly his band Pariah was dumped from their record label Geffen Records shortly before he passed.</p><p>“He never left a note,” Bonnie explained. “He’d already tried to kill himself but his brother Kyle took the gun away from him. So he went and got another. That’s why I’m against the gun laws.”</p><p>Bonnie and Renée got on well. “I was the sales lady for the Pariah T-shirt booth and [Renée] always helped me,” she said. “It was clear that he loved her a lot. Renée was his favorite girlfriend.”</p><p>The acclaimed actress spoke at Sims’ funeral. “I don’t remember what she said,” Bonnie admitted, “but I’m sure it was wonderful. She always was a good public speaker.”</p><p>Renée again paid tribute to her ex at the Austin Music Awards to honor the 20th anniversary of his death. She was there as an honorary presenter. Leaving behind a legacy, the Sims Foundation charity, started in his name, is a local Austin organization that helps musicians grappling with their mental health.</p><p>“Renée has acknowledged that Sims was her big love,” Bonnie once <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> RadarOnline.com.</p><p><strong>If you are affected by any issues raised in the article or would like someone to speak to, please call the Samaritans for free on 116 123.

He was 35.</p><p>Waring's sister, Ashley Zarlin, paid tribute to her brother on <a href=#><strong>Instagram</strong></a> while stating that he died from "the relentless grip of addiction." She posted a carousel of images from their lives growing up together, along with a heartfelt message.</p><p>"He was brilliant and had limitless potential, but addiction veered him off course," she wrote, calling addiction "a disease that distorts and destroys, leaving behind shattered dreams and broken hearts."</p><p>"My heart aches for the lost opportunities for us to grow together as adults, to share laughter and dreams, the conversations that we will never get to have, and the dreams that will be left unfulfilled," Zarlin continued.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9c7a4854-2712-43b2-a51e-a41398ea1fc4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:546afa0b-01b5-4515-8fc6-031456f0f1c8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/39/5by4/2024/04/05/39233f8c71e74b92b48c19a0f09dc590_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram / Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Kurt Cobain's Daughter Frances Bean Shares Powerful Message About Grief on 30th Anniversary of His Death</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She praised their mother for fighting alongside him, "never wavering in her belief that he could overcome this demon," while wishing that she could have done more to change this tragic outcome.</p><p>Then, Zarlin called for change in the healthcare system to prioritize "compassion and support above all else," saying that our current system "failed him time and again."</p><p>"I pray for a world where compassion and effective support systems replace judgment and neglect, so that others may find the help they desperately need," she wrote.</p><p>In her own <a href=#><strong>post</strong></a>, Peterson wrote, "No one can ever prepare you for this feeling of such deep loss. Every fiber in my body hurts. Josh fought every single day for most of his adult life, for his life, but this past Sunday, the challenge was too great."</p><p>She eulogized her son beautifully, talking about his joy-filled childhood and his ability to be optimistic and kind through "adult hardship." "He received the most joy, pride and purpose through his daughter Kennady and watching her grow and thrive over the years," wrote Peterson.</p><p>She went on to thank everyone who tried to help Josh in his struggles with addiction, as well as all the support she's received while trying to help him.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5256119b-a067-4962-a143-ee992131764e data-container-ref=toofab:article:546afa0b-01b5-4515-8fc6-031456f0f1c8 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e3/5by4/2024/03/14/e34cabcf088a42de8e9609b3f1cf3b26_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC / Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Regina King Speaks About Son Ian's Death for First Time: 'The Sadness Will Never Go Away'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"Josh I love you so much and I will miss you terribly!

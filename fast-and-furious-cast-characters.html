After nearly $5 billion from the worldwide box office so far, the Universal Pictures property shows no signs of slowing down. And yet with nine movies and counting, including the recently released spinoff and the upcoming <a href=#><strong>Fast 9</strong></a>, it's difficult to keep track of the myriad characters who have come and gone over the years.

The son of a stock car racer who died on the track, Dom did a two-year stint in Lompoc Prison for assaulting the racer who clipped his father's car during a race and ultimate caused his death. Audiences meet Dom and his crew-which includes childhood sweetheart Letty Ortiz and his friends, Vince, Leon, and Jesse-as they participate in illegal street races and boost high-end electronics from tractor trailers in transit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/the-fast-and-the-furious-vin-diesel-600x396.jpg><p>The plot thickens when Brian O'Conner, an undercover cop going by the name of Brian Earl Spilner infiltrates Dom's crew, earns their friendship, and even wins the heart of Dom's sister, Mia, despite Dominic's protests. Together they are (mostly) able to survive the bad blood with a rival gang led by Johnny Tran and a botched attempt at stealing one last batch of electronics before fleeing to Mexico. When Dom learns of Brian's true identity, he's surprised to find that the cop is letting him go after Tran and his henchman who have shot one of their own. Their tense friendship is put to a final test in a quarter-mile race that ends in a horrific crash that Dom barely survives; Brian gifts him the keys to his own ten-second car that he owed him, allowing him to escape the police who are soon to arrive.</p><p><strong>2 Fast 2 Furious</strong> - Diesel has no on-screen presence, but Dom is often mentioned by other characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Los Bandoleros</strong> - This 2009 short film was written, directed, and produced by Diesel, who starred alongside his franchise cast members. This film sees Dom and his friends in the Dominican Republic after leaving Mexico behind. After befriending some of the locals, they plan to bust one of them out of prison before heading off to hijack a gasoline shipment; Dom intends for the gas to be distributed to the citizens. Later, he's found out be Letty, who tracked him from Mexico. The two rekindle their romance and decide to get married in a local church, vowing that they'll "ride or die" together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fast-and-furious-vin-diesel-600x399.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Fast & Furious&nbsp;</strong>- After successfully stealing the gas from a tanker, the team decides to split their earnings and go their separate ways. Despite their recent marriage, Dom parts ways with Letty, but leaves his share of the money and a cross to her. Tragically, while Dom is in Panama, he's informed of Letty's death in a fatal car crash; Dom and his sister Mia suspect foul play, and he returns to Los Angeles to investigate. His search leads him to a man named David Park, the same man sought by now-FBI agent, Brian O'Conner.</p><p>Dom and Brian soon end up facing off in a Los Angeles street race to become a driver for international drug dealer Arturo Braga. Dom wins his place after forcing Brian and his car out of the race, but Brian is able to find a way onto the team as well. Soon, Dom spurns the affections of one of Braga's employees, Gisele Yashar, thinking only of Letty.

Dom also gets revenge for Letty's murder by hitting Fenix with a Camaro at high speed and pinning his body against another wrecked car. Rather than run from the police who are arriving on scene, Dom stays and awaits his fate, which is his arrest and sentencing to 25 years in Lompoc without parole, despite Brian's connections.

Though Mia is able to escape the inevitable betrayal (in a car that contains a much sought-after microchip), Dom and Brian are temporarily taken hostage after a death-defying plunge from a cliff into a river far beneath a bridge.

Dom forms up a new team and forces Reyes to consolidate his money in one place by burning down one of his safe houses and planning to do the same to the rest of his money. (They also have a quarter-mile race for $1 million, which Dom lets Brian win as an early gift to his new nephew.)

Tragically, Walker lost his life in a car accident that hit too close to home for the friends, family, and fandom who had come to know him as Brian O'Conner from the Universal Pictures franchise.&nbsp;Furious 7 saw a fitting send-off for the late Walker and his character, one which took a look back at his most exciting and emotional moments from the franchise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/the-fast-and-the-furious-paul-walker-395x600.jpg><p>Brian O'Conner was introduced to audiences as an L.A.P.D. officer hoping to make detective, but his backstory has been filled in a little more over the years. He grew up in Barstow and was childhood friends with fellow trouble-maker Roman Pearce; he&nbsp;never knew his father and&nbsp;was raised by his mother. Brian's involvement with law enforcement cost him his friendship with Roman, but an undercover assignment investigating a string of highway hijackings led to new friendships with a number of low-level criminals in Dominic Toretto's crew.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brian's cover as an employee for auto parts shop The Racer's Edge brings him into proximity with Toretto's Market & Cafe, along with his love interest Mia, and the lead suspect in his case, Dom Toretto. A dust-up between Brian and Dom's friend Vince over continued flirtation with Mia puts Brian squarely on Dom's radar, but his police connections keeps his cover intact. It also gives him access to plenty of nitrous oxide which he uses to participate in illegal street races. On his first outing, he wagers his pink slips against other racers and loses quite badly to Dom, who takes his law enforcement-sanctioned street rod. Adding insult to injury, the car is soon forfeit due to Brian and Dom wandering into rival Johnny Tran's territory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Brian is pulled into Dom's inner circle, the cops make a show of arresting him in order to be brought up to speed with his new intel. Due to the burgeoning friendship with Dom and the budding romance with Mia, Brian opts to investigate Tran's crew instead of Dom's. Their bonds grow closer as they work on restoring a new car for Brian to race, something Special Agent Bilkins and Sergeant Tanner keep an eye on as they're concerned that their undercover agent is "going native." In order to keep him on the straight and narrow, they show Brian the file on Kenny Linder, a racer Dom nearly beat to death years earlier.</p><p>But after hearing Dom's side of the story, and after pressure from his superiors, Brian opts to pull the trigger on arresting Tran's crew for the heists instead of seeing the real criminals right in front of him. When that operation goes poorly, Brian's last chance to get in on Dom's side business is to win at Race Wars using his new car. Unfortunately, tensions between rival gangs spill out during the race event, and Brian is forced to expose his cover to Mia. His betrayal puts their relationship in jeopardy, but she informs him of Dom's plans so that he can hopefully keep the heist team from getting killed by the armed truck driver they're about to hijack. Brian is able to intercept the failed robbery and save Vince from certain death, but in doing so he reveals his true identity to Dom and his crew, forming a rift between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, he can't save Dom's friend Jesse, who is gunned down by Lance, one of Tran's crew. Brian pursues the hitman in a high-speed chase and eventually shoots Tran to death, but is saved from being shot himself when Dom takes out Lance. Brian and Dom's relationship is put to the ultimate test when a quarter-mile race against an oncoming train leaves Dom injured and his car destroyed; Brian gifts Dom the ten-second car he owed him and gives him a free pass from the cops ... this time.</p><p><strong>Turbo-Charged Prelude</strong> - If you were left wondering what happened to Brian after his decision to shirk responsibility and let a criminal go free, you should check out this 2003 short film.

Along the way, he meets a mysterious girl who helps him avoid the local and federal authorities who have organized a manhunt to find him. He eventually has to ditch the Mitsubishi and opts for a Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 instead, upgrading it&nbsp;as he goes with his earnings from various street races. After opting out of a race against motorcyclists, Brian decides to head towards Miami instead of New York City. It's there that he befriends Tej Parker and starts working at the former street racer's garage, earning the nickname "Bullitt" as he builds his own reputation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2-fast-2-furious-paul-walker.jpg><p><strong>2 Fast 2 Furious</strong> - It's in Miami that Brian ends up winning a quarter-mile race as a last-minute racer in a four-man competition.

This leads Brian and Roman to patch things up between them before risking their lives on the final mission, which will have them transporting Verone's drug money and likely being executed upon delivery. Instead, the Miami police give chase, Brian and Roman switch cars, and their street-racing allies flood the city streets with hundreds of cars, confusing all pursuers.

Brian's then able to shoot the plane's wing flap in order to keep it from taking off, and they then get far enough away from the crash and resulting explosion to watch events unfold from afar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After having their records cleared, the gang returns to the Toretto house in Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/furious-7-paul-walker-600x400.jpg><p><strong>Furious 7&nbsp;</strong>- Following the events in London, Brian is struggling to come to grips with civilian life and fatherhood. He admits to missing the blood and bullets of their action-packed lives, so Mia keeps her second pregnancy a secret from him for the time being. But when a bomb meant to kill the entire Toretto/O'Conner family only destroys their house instead, Brian and Mia soon find themselves thrust back into a dangerous situation. After setting up a safehouse for Mia and Jack in the Dominican Republic, Brian searches for Deckard Shaw and promises to make this mission his last one ever.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brian makes a similar promise to Roman at Han's funeral in Los Angeles, saying that there would be no more funerals for their crew after Deckard is put into the ground. He's soon strapped into a driver's seat of a car that parachutes down to a road in the Caucasus Mountains as part of Mr. Nobody's plan to rescue the talented hacker known as Ramsey. Brian manages to board some of the convoy's vehicles, dispatch the guards, and rescue Ramsey, shoving her to a place of relative safety on the hood of Dom's Charger. Brian's own escape is narrower still as he's only just able to grab the tail end of Letty's Challenger as she drifts its back end out over the edge of a crumbling cliff.</p><p>After convincing Ramsey to share whatever information she knew with Dom's team, Brian confessed to Dom that he loved the adrenaline rush of their latest adventure. Though Dom admires his friend's courage, he says that the bravest thing he's done is being a good man&nbsp;to Mia and a father to Jack. However, both Brian and Dom show some bravery by driving a Lykan HyperSport through three luxury towers in order to keep the God's Eye surveillance device safely out of Deckard's hands. However, an ambush leaves Mr. Nobody injured and ends up with Deckard obtaining the God's Eye after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/furious-7-gibson-rodriguez-walker-bridges-600x400.jpg><p>The team returns to Los Angeles where Brian calls Mia one last time, asking her to take care of Jack if he doesn't make it home. It's here that she reveals that they're expecting a baby girl; they reminisce about the way they met so many years ago. Brian then dons his FBI tactical gear for what will be his last mission, one way or another.</p><p>With Ramsey riding shotgun, he attempts to avoid a drone as long as possible before he's forced to hand her off into another car. Unable to shake the drone in the city, Brian dives out of his Nissan GT-R moments before the drone blows it up. He then runs to the nearest radio tower, dispatching henchmen along the way, in order to establish a network link-up so that Ramsey can finish hacking the God's Eye. As she works, Brian assists Hobbs in saving Dom from the wreckage of his crashed Charger.

The character needed a strong personality in order to stand up to the likes of her brother Dom and to hold her own amidst his rough-and-tumble friends. Though Mia doesn't often get involved in the high-octane hijinks, she does have quite a few memorable moments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/the-fast-and-the-furious-jordana-brewster-600x396.jpg><p>Perhaps the richest role for Brewster was in creating Mia in the original 2001 film. Mia is no pushover; she keeps Dom in line, shuts down Vince's affections at every turn, and makes Brian earn every step forward in their relationship. In fact, their young romance crashes and burns when Brian reveals himself to be an undercover cop, which Mia takes to heart as an unforgivable betrayal that isn't resolved until a few films down the line. She's the heart and soul of this franchise, which has become more about family at its core than anyone would have guessed 15 years ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Fast & Furious&nbsp;</strong>- In this film, Mia is reduced to being a target of surveillance by the FBI, though she does have the important plot point of calling Dom to inform him of Letty's death. She accompanies Dom to both the site of Letty's murder and the resulting funeral, but spends most of her dialogue attempting to keep Dom out of trouble.</p><p>The bright side of Mia's arc in this installment is that she gets to reconcile with Brian, a turning point that will completely change the tone of the franchise going forward. This film merely implies that they get back together while future films make it a strong central conceit to the theme of "family."</p><p>But Mia also gets in on the action here as she joins the team to bust Dom out of the prison convoy in the final act.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fast-five-jordana-brewster-600x399.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Fast Five&nbsp;</strong>- After that successful prison break, Mia and Brian seek sanctuary in Rio with her childhood friend Vince. Not only does he provide a safe shelter for the lovebirds, he offers up a job boosting expensive cars from a passenger train. Mia gets the rare opportunity to join in on the action in this installment as she steals the Ford GT40, the very car that Hernan Reyes was specifically after.</p><p>She also provides the sole agent of restraint in these films, pleading with Dom not to kill Hobbs during their fight and revealing her pregnancy to Brian along with some pleas to keep himself safe. Unfortunately, her pregnancy more or less takes her out of the action, though she does perform some intelligence and surveillance activities during the Rio heist, guiding the team through the chaotic streets. After that successful mission, the Toretto/O'Conner family moves to an idyllic retreat in the Canary Islands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Fast & Furious 6&nbsp;</strong>- A year after the birth of her son Jack, Mia stays behind when Dom and Brian head off to London in an attempt to bring Letty back home. She's reduced to a damsel in distress role here as the villainous Shaw's crew kidnaps her in an attempt to use her as leverage against Dom and Brian. To her credit, she does get Jack to safety before sacrificing herself to the kidnappers, and she&nbsp;does manage to help bring down Shaw's plane after her friends and family rescue her.</p><p><strong>Furious 7&nbsp;</strong>- While celebrating with Dom about the new baby girl that she's about to have, Mia and her family are almost killed thanks to a bomb delivered by Deckard Shaw. This pretty much keeps Mia out of the picture for the rest of the film, except for the scenes in which Brian calls home to tell his girlfriend that he may not be making it home this time. The most touching moments in perhaps the entire franchise are of the final scenes with Mia, Brian, and Jack on the beach, mostly because this was a farewell to the late Paul Walker and a fitting goodbye to his character. Mia, however, soldiers on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><strong>The Fate of the Furious</strong>&nbsp;</strong>- Brewster does&nbsp;appear in this film or future films, but she is mentioned in dialogue since the team apparently promised&nbsp;not to involve her and Brian in their trouble.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/fast-furious-7-vin-diesel-jordana-brewster-600x312.jpg><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=michelle-rodriguez-as-letty-ortiz>Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fast-and-furious-cast-character-guide-michelle-rodriguez-letty-ortiz-slice.jpg><p><strong>The Fast and the Furious</strong> - Providing strong evidence that women are every bit as capable as men when it comes to driving fast, hitting hard, and bringing adrenaline-fueled action scenes to the big screen, <strong>Michelle Rodriguez's</strong> Letty Ortiz is one of the franchise's standout characters. You might have guessed that based on her introduction in the 2001 film as a no-nonsense girlfriend of Dominic Toretto, but you'd be hard-pressed to see the trajectory her character's arc would eventually take.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/the-fast-and-the-furious-michelle-rodriguez-600x396.jpg><p>Letty, the childhood sweetheart of Dom and friend of Mia and the crew, has been a street racer about as long as the guys have. In fact, as the sole member of their gang of hijackers, Letty is arguably the most level-headed and loyal of the bunch. She was "ride or die" with Dom well before their inevitable vows were exchanged, and it was plain to see as much in this very first film. Letty's also quite capable as a racer herself, as evidenced by her victory at Race Wars. However, she suffers injuries in a bad wreck toward the end of the film, which would bode ill for future installments.</p><p><strong>Los Bandoleros</strong> - In this short film, Letty is reunited with Dom in the Dominican Republic after he left Los Angeles years earlier. She tracks him from Mexico in order to rekindle their romance, which results in the two of them exchanging vows in a marriage ceremony.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fast-and-furious-michelle-rodriguez-400x600.jpg><p><strong>Fast & Furious </strong>- After hijacking a gas tanker with their new crew in the Dominican Republic, Dom leaves Letty behind once again. She goes to see FBI Agent Brian O'Conner with the hopes of clearing Dom's name so he can come home without having to look over his shoulder. With Brian's help, she then decides to go undercover as a driver for drug dealer Arturo Braga. The mission is going well until Fenix Calderon, one of Braga's henchmen, intentionally flips her car after a successful delivery. Letty is injured in the crash and Fenix shoots at her, but shoots the car instead. It blows up and throws Letty's body into the underbrush where she's left for dead. Her friends and family presume as much even though her body was never found.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In actuality, Letty suffered severe amnesia and was brought to a hospital by Braga's employee, Gisele. Two days later, Owen Shaw, acting on Braga's intel, went there to kill her but found her to be a useful recruit thanks to her skills, experience, and lack of memory of her previous life.</p><p><strong>Fast Five </strong>- While DSS Agent Luke Hobbs is investigating Shaw, U.S. Customs agent Monica Fuentes hands him a file about a heist committed in Berlin. The file contains an image of Letty, suggesting that she's alive and involved in a large-scale criminal organization.</p><p><strong>Fast & Furious 6 </strong>- Knowing that Letty is alive and needing Dom's help to track down Shaw, Hobbs shares his intel with Toretto. It turns out that Letty is indeed working for Shaw and her amnesia prevents her from fully recognizing Dom when they come face to face. In fact, she shoots him in the shoulder and soon flees. However, as Dom acknowledges, if she had wanted to kill him, she easily could have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interesting twist on conventional plot, we actually get to see a conversation between the villain and the memory-challenged Letty about Dom and her former life, a chat which shifts the perspective to a more mysterious side of their relationship. In another script flip, Letty and DSS agent Riley (<strong>Gina Carano</strong>) engage in a fierce battle, a one-on-one fight that's easily one of the best in the franchise. Letty manages to escape and reports back to Shaw, but despite her lack of memory, his emotionless reaction to the news of one of his team member's deaths rubs her the wrong way. Tension builds between the two as Shaw questions whether or not she could kill Dom, but it breaks when Shaw runs his tank over innocent bystanders.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fast-and-furious-6-michelle-rodriguez-600x400.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite their animosity, Letty still listens to Shaw when he orders her to free an anchoring cable from the tank, a maneuver which will certainly throw her to her death. Shaw knows this, and he knows that Dom does, too. When Letty is inevitably launched through the air, Dom throws himself into harm's way in order to catch her; both of them land safely on the hood of another car. In addition to literally putting their bodies on the line for her, Dom and Brian also support the story that Letty was always on their side even when it looked like she was working with Shaw.</p><p>Letty gets to firmly establish her loyalty to Dom and the team by assisting them in rescuing Mia from Shaw's plane. She gets to fight Riley again, getting the worst of it until she's able to shoot Riley out the door of the moving plane. Though she manages to get to safety, Letty's worried that Dom did not survive the horrific plane crash, resulting explosion, and follow-up car crash that left wreckage scattered across the runway. Luckily, he did, and Letty welcomes him with an embrace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back at Dom's old address, the gang has a barbecue to celebrate. Letty and Elena talk, each admiring the other and sharing their admiration for Dom as well. Elena gives them both her blessing. Though Letty's memories haven't returned, she says that this place feels like home, and she's fully comfortable sitting in Dom's lap.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/furious-7-michelle-rodriguez-letty-600x400.jpg><p><strong>Furious 7 </strong>- After attending Race Wars back in Los Angeles, Letty gets her memory jogged in a disturbing way. She visits the cemetery in which her funeral was held and then tells Dom that she needs to go find herself, leaving him behind temporarily. It's not long before she comes back and rejoins the team just before they go off to rescue Ramsey from the terrorists.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the infiltration of the prince's party, Letty gets to have another excellent fight against Kara, played by <strong>Ronda Rousey</strong>. Sadly, that's about all the action that Letty gets in this installment, though it's her words to Dom that bring him back from the brink of death near the movie's end. She's apparently regained her memories and cheerfully joins the crew on the beach as they bid farewell to Brian and Mia.</p><p><strong><strong>The Fate of the Furious</strong>&nbsp;</strong>- Letty deals with the apparent betrayal of her and the team by Dom better than anyone else; she never loses faith in him. Not knowing that Cipher coerced Dom while in Cuba, the next time she meets him face to face after his turn is when he attempts to steal the nuclear codes in New York. Letty manages to get the briefcase from him but is almost killed by Rhodes in the process. Dom stands up for her though Letty gives up the codes and allows Dom and Rhodes to escape. Letty remains on the team as they track down Dom and put a stop to Cipher's plans. She's also receptive to Dom's son Brian, presumably after he explains everything to her.

However, where Brian's path followed a turn to law enforcement, Roman went to prison for two months after being caught housing stolen cars in a garage. He grew to resent Brian, thinking his friend could have done something to prevent his predicament; Roman would go on to spend three more years in an upstate prison before being released on house arrest.</p><p>At the time of Roman and Brian's reunion, Roman is employed as a destruction derby driver. Though Roman recognizes Brian, he no longer considers him a friend, which leads to a dust-up between the two.

Eventually, Roman admits that his own problems in his past were of his own making, just as Brian admits that the reason he let Dom go was in part because of the guilt he felt for not helping Roman when he had the chance. With that tension now eased, the two friends orchestrate a plan that will keep them out of jail but also keep them from being killed by the backstabbing Verone.</p><p>Roman and Brian manage to save U.S. Customs agent Monica Fuentes, who then captures Verone alive, though Roman breaks his arm in the process.

When the team pulls off the heist, Roman buys a&nbsp;Koenigsegg CCXR from an Abu Dhabi sheik along with a private jet.</p><p>This is the first film in which Roman is presented as more of a supporting character, specifically a comedic one. Instead of focusing on the friendship between Brian and Roman, there's more attention paid to the good-natured humor between Roman and Tej, and their ongoing attempts to talk up the ladies. It's a relationship that's worked well in support of the team throughout the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Fast & Furious 6&nbsp;</strong>- Though Roman is happy living a life of luxury and ease, and was headed to Macau, he's called back in to help Dom and Brian bring Letty back home after she's discovered to be alive. Roman's claim to fame in this film is the use of his car as an anchor that stops a stolen tank in its tracks; he dives to safety onto his buddy Brian's car before the tank itself flips over. He also helps to keep Shaw's plane from taking off by tethering it to his vehicle.

When earlier plans fail, Tej devises a dangerous scheme that will take them close enough to the device to hack it and disable it, though it will put them in the crosshairs of drones, military helicopters, and numerous soldiers. At the end of the day, Tej joined his teammates bidding farewell to Brian, Mia, and their family along the beach.</p><p><strong>The Fate of the Furious&nbsp;</strong>- Tej brings his technical expertise and particular brand of humor to this movie, and gets to drive that ridiculous Ripsaw Army vehicle across the ice. Other than working alongside Ramsey to try to track down Dom and Cipher, and verbally sparring with Roman throughout the movie, Tej doesn't have too much to do but go along for the ride. Still, he plays a part in stopping Cipher's plans and getting Dom back in good graces with the team.

Audiences had spent four films watching their team of anti-heroes elude law enforcement in style, but now they were introduced to a group of badge-carrying good guys they could&nbsp;also root for. Inevitably everyone ended up on the same side, but the road to get to that point was a very entertaining one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fast-five-dwayne-johnson-399x600.jpg><p>Hobbs is an agent for the Diplomatic Security Service, an agency tasked with bringing in wanted criminals like Dominic Toretto, Brian O'Conner, and Owen Shaw. While few personal details about Hobbs are available, it's eventually revealed that he has a daughter named Samantha. But in his first film of the franchise, all we know is that Hobbs will do anything to bring in Dom, Brian, and Mia when they're suspected of killing DEA agents during a train heist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hobbs not only chases Dom across village rooftops, he actually comes face to face with him in a Brazilian market, but is out-manned and out-gunned, forcing the big man to back down. It's not until he tracks them down to Dom's warehouse that Hobbs gets to engage in a hand-to-hand fight with Toretto, a fight which Hobbs just barely loses but is lucky to walk away from thanks to Mia pleading for Dom to stay his hand. Hobbs then takes the team into custody, but their convoy is attacked by Reyes' men; four of Hobbs' agents are killed in the process as he temporarily allies with Toretto's crew when they save him from certain death.</p><p>Their teamwork continues as Hobbs helps the team steal Reyes' money since it will give him a chance to avenge the death of his fellow agents. He's able to do just that by killing Reyes. Though Hobbs gives the team a 24-hour window before he'll start searching for them again, in the end he discovers that they've swapped bank vaults and have escaped with $100 million in laundered bills; Hobbs merely laughs it off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fast-and-furious-6-dwayne-johnson-600x400.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Fast & Furious 6&nbsp;</strong>- Acting on intel from U.S. Customs agent Monica Fuentes, Hobbs approaches Dom with evidence that Letty is still alive. He uses this information to persuade Dom and his team to help bring down Letty's mercenary employer, Owen Shaw.&nbsp;In return, Hobbs will clear their criminal records.</p><p>Hobbs and his partner Riley keep back away from the action for the majority of this film, though they enter in at pivotal moments. When Dom squares off against Shaw over Letty, Hobbs reveals his presence as a counter-sniper to the shooters on Shaw's team, a strategic move which likely saves Dom's life. Later, when the team is taking out the stolen tank, Hobbs' crew follows the action from a helicopter and apprehends Shaw once the chase comes to a close.</p><p>However, Shaw has a bargaining chip on his side as his team has taken Mia hostage. Hobbs sides with Toretto's crew against the British military and forces them to let Shaw and his people go...including the traitor, Riley. She gets her just deserts, however, when Hobbs helps Letty shoot Riley out of Shaw's plane before it crashes and explodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the destruction of the plane, Dom arrives to hand the computer chip back to Hobbs in exchange for amnesty for his crew.

Hobbs catches him too late and the two engage in a fight, which ends with Hobbs and Elena diving out of a nearby window to escape a bomb blast. This leaves Hobbs with a broken arm and leg, landing him in the hospital. There, he's visited by his daughter Samantha, as well as Elena and Dom, who arrives after Shaw blows up his house.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Hobbs is recovering, Dom's team goes in pursuit of Shaw to avenge the death of their friend Han. Once the chase leads through the streets&nbsp;of Los Angeles, Hobbs busts out of his cast and goes to help Dom and his team with his daughter's blessing. His manner of assistance includes commandeering an ambulance which he launches into an attack drone to disable it, then uses the drone's turret gun to shoot at&nbsp;an enemy helicopter. He uses the same gun to detonate a bag of grenades that Dom manages to hook on the helicopter's skids, taking the machine down for good. Once their enemies are down and their allies are all accounted for, Hobbs arrests Deckard Shaw and locks him up in a CIA maximum security prison.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-fate-of-the-furious-dwayne-johnson-600x251.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><strong>The Fate of the Furious</strong>&nbsp;</strong>- Hobbs had&nbsp;plenty of work to do in this movie, which is interesting considering that he isn't initially part of the team. In fact, he's busy coaching his daughter's soccer team (and fending off soccer moms) when he's recruited back into action, to his daughter's displeasure. It's during the heist to steal the EMP that Hobbs is left inured on the side of the road due to Dom's betrayal, is arrested by the authorities, and taken to an ultramax security prison. It's here that Mr. Nobody and Little Nobody attempt to secure a deal for Hobbs, but he's not interested. It's also here that Hobbs comes face to face with Shaw once again.</p><p>An ill-fated attempt to break Hobbs out of his cell ends up with Shaw escaping and allowing all the other inmates to escape as well. A completely insane action sequence follows as all hell breaks loose and both Shaw and Hobbs fight their way out of the prison, only to be stopped from killing each other by Mr. Nobody's team. The feuding pair end up reuniting with Dom's teammates in order to help track him down, and they come to a mutual respect and understanding over time due to their similar service records and checkered pasts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After playing the strongman role in attempting to stop Dom in New York and taking down Cipher in Russia (and redirecting a torpedo bare-handed...), Hobbs is offered his DSS job back, or a job working for Mr. Nobody, but he declines in order to spend more time with his daughter.

None of the usual characters beyond Hobbs and Shaw themselves show up in this one, but there are some great cameos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The plot is pretty straight-forward here: Hobbs is called back into action, not by the DSS but by the CIA through Locke (<strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong>), an old acquaintance of Hobbs' who's a bit of a fanboy. He's tasked with tracking down a rogue MI6 agent (<strong>Vanessa Kirby</strong>) who's in possession of a deadly virus that threatens the entire world. The issue is that the agent, Hattie Shaw, was actually keeping the virus out of the hands of the cybernetically enhanced mercenary Brixton (<strong>Idris Elba</strong>) and was then forced to go on the run. Deckard Shaw, who just so happens to be Hattie's brother, is also called in to find her, forcing Hobbs and Shaw(s) to work together to save the world.</p><p>The rest of the story plays out pretty much the way you'd expect, but the important parts are the character reveals. We learn about Hobbs' childhood in Samoa and of the existence of his older brother, Jonah (<strong>Cliff Curtis</strong>). When Hobbs was a kid, their father was a criminal who stole cars, boats, trucks, and pretty much anything with an engine. When he needed a new crew, their father would come home and recruit his sons, but his ruthlessness put them all in mortal danger. It was Luke Hobbs who turned his father in, and then turned his back on the rest of his family. While he climbed the ranks of the DSS, Jonah took over the family business and legitimized it, starting the vehicle customization company Hobbs Customs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/hobbs-and-shaw-dwayne-johnson-565x600.jpg><p>Luke returned home to patch things up with his family and ask for their help in defeating Brixton, keeping Hattie safe, and retrieving the virus. Once they successfully defeated the mercenary team, Luke brought his daughter Samantha to Samoa to meet her grandmother, uncle, and extended family. He also shared a romantic moment with Hattie herself, so perhaps Samantha will have a new mother figure in her life before long.</p><p>But it looks like Hobbs will get back into the action again soon. A series of credits scenes features Locke calling him back into action to retrieve yet another deadly virus that was worse than the first one. What's more interesting here is that the mysterious computer-voiced villain who's in charge of the tech cult Eteon claimed to have a past with Hobbs and a connection that is going to shock him to his core ...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/furious-7-dwayne-johnson-600x400.jpg><h2 id=sung-kang-as-han-seoul-oh>Sung Kang as Han Seoul-Oh</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fast-and-furious-cast-character-guide-sung-kang-han-seoul-oh-slice.jpg><p><strong>Los Bandoleros</strong> - Let's first get this out of the way: Yes, the franchise named a character after Han Solo. What could easily have been a running joke actually turned into one of the franchise's most heartbreaking storylines.&nbsp;<strong>Sung Kang's</strong> portrayal of Han brought heart and humor to Dom's team, and his ultimate death gives them a reason to keep on fighting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But back before all that, Han ran into Dom in Mexico where he lost a car to the superior street racer.

When Takashi challenges Sean to a drift race and he accepts, Han lets him borrow his car, curious to see what the brash driver can do. Sean loses, of course, and destroys Han's car in the process, so he becomes Han's errand boy to pay down the debt; Han also teaches him how to drift race at the same time.</p><p>However, Takashi soon confronts Han about the missing money, which Han admits to before escaping in his car, leading Takashi on a race through Tokyo.

After thinking back on their childhood in which Deckard protected the younger Owen from the abuse of their father and other difficulties, he decides to do right by his little brother.</p><p>As Deckard aims to systematically take Dom's team apart, he first starts with an infiltration of the DSS to gain information on all of them. In doing so, he also injures Hobbs and nearly kills Elena. He follows that up by killing Han and sending a bomb to Toretto's house with the intent on wiping out a significant chunk of the team; he only succeeds in destroying their family home and royally pissing them off. Deckard then observes Han's funeral back in Los Angeles in order to lure Dom into a chase. His plan works, and after crashing their cars into each other in a game of chicken, Deckard gets the upper hand on Dom by pulling a gun on him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily for Dom, Mr. Nobody's forces step in and save his hide. Though Deckard retreats for the moment, he next attacks the team when they're attempting to rescue the hacker Ramsey from a mountaintop convoy. Though he fails in defeating them, he does form an alliance with the terrorist Mose Jakande. Dom and Brian are able to escape near death yet again when Deckard tracks them to a party in Abu Dhabi. They turn the tables on him and use the powerful surveillance program God's Eye to track Deckard down, but he's actually lying in wait with Jakande's mercenaries as his backup. Dom's crew escapes, but Deckard uses the newly obtained God's Eye to track them to Los Angeles.</p><p>An all-out battle ensues through the city streets, culminating with another street fight between Dom and Deckard. The villain holds his own until Jakande double crosses him and destroys part of the parking garage they're battling on. When Dom stomps on a section of the roof, it collapses beneath Deckard's feet. He survives the fall and resulting collapse, at which point Hobbs takes him into custody and places him in a maximum security prison.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/the-fate-of-the-furious-jason-statham-600x251.jpg><p><strong><strong>The Fate of the Furious</strong>&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;This movie could have done a lot of things with Deckard Shaw and his brother Owen, but what it chose to do is perhaps the best course to take. It turns out that Deckard and Owen were coerced into their criminal behavior in the same way Dom was, by Cipher. Deckard breaks out of the ultramax security prison along with Hobbs when Mr. Nobody recruits the both of them to track down the rogue Dom Toretto. They form an awkward friendship based on mutual respect and toughness, as bros do.</p><p>Deckard then becomes a very useful member of the team, helping to sort out Cipher's systems and figure out just where the villainess is heading next. He's on the team that tracks Dom to New York, but when he confronts him, Dom presumably shoots him dead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But as is the case in these movies, Deckard's death was a ruse that allowed him to infiltrate Cipher's plane later on thanks to a winged flight suit and his brother Owen by his side. This was all arranged thanks to Dom and Magdalene Shaw (<strong>Helen Mirren</strong>), Deckard and Owen's mother. Deckard not only took out Cipher's security team, he also rescued Dom's son and returned him safely to his father, securing a place within the extended family. He did, however, lose Cipher in the process since she parachuted from the plane.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/hobbs-and-shaw-jason-statham-social-600x369.jpg><p><strong>Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw </strong>- <strong><span style=color:red>Spoilers Follow</span></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Don't expect any main story cast or characters to show up, though there are some fun cameos here. new to the party is <strong>Rob Delaney</strong>'s CIA agent Loeb. He recruits Shaw to bring in his own sister, Hattie, who's in possession of a deadly virus that threatens the entire world. Spurred on by the Shaw matriarch Queenie, who's in prison but rather enjoying her leisure time there, Deckard opts to track down Hattie in order to keep her safe but ends up having to work with his rival, Hobbs.</p><p>Throughout the movie, we get some backstory on the Shaw siblings. As kids, they would perform a number of grifts and heists, all with musical artist names like "The Mick Jagger" and "The Keith Moon." (Let's ignore the fact that Statham and Kirby are more than 20 years apart in age and just pretend that they could have been kids at the same time.) Perhaps more important are the hints at the backstory between Deckard and Brixton, the cybernetically enhanced super soldier who was once (nearly) executed by Deckard himself. While serving MI6, it was actually Brixton who betrayed the team and turned against his country with the promise of greater rewards through Eteon, perhaps connected through Cipher's cyberterrorist organization. This betrayal forces Deckard to go on the run as a mercenary for hire, but it's a breezy explanation for things like the murder of Han Seoul-Oh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hobbs-and-shaw-jason-statham-600x252.jpg><p>With an assist from Air Marshal Dinkley (<strong>Kevin Hart</strong>), the Shaws and Hobbs travel to Samoa to set up an ambush on Brixton, extract the virus from Hattie, and defeat the villainous organization of Eteon, temporarily. The mysterious leader of that organization wants to recruit both Hobbs and Shaw into their ranks. The men refuse, but they'll surely be dealing with them in the near future.</p><p>Having learned of Deckard's setup by Brixton, Hattie opts to reconnect with her sibling; together, they visit Queenie in prison and plan to help her escape.

Luckily, few people question Mr. Nobody's motives and nick-of-time arrivals because of the gravitas brought to the character by Russell, so it frees up the writers of the story to use a little deus ex machina when needed.&nbsp;In fact, Mr. Nobody's very introduction is the textbook definition of the term.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/furious-7-vin-diesel-paul-walker-kurt-russell-600x400.jpg><p>At the request of Hobbs and the DSS, covert government agent Mr. Nobody and his soldiers arrive on the scene to prevent Deckard Shaw from killing Dom. After a brief misunderstanding in which Dom almost chokes out Mr. Nobody's second in command, Sheppard, the two sides come to an agreement: Dom's crew will help rescue Ramsey for her knowledge about the God's Eye device, which they can then use to track down Deckard and bring him to justice.</p><p>However, the attempted apprehension of Deckard was a trap set by the villain, who ambushes Mr. Nobody, Sheppard, Dom, and Brian with the help of Jakande's men. Sheppard is killed and Mr. Nobody is injured, so Dom and Brian manage to help him escape to a safe distance.

Luckily, Little Nobody learns quickly after getting on the wrong side of Hobbs, Roman, and the team, and becomes an asset to them by the movie's end.

However,&nbsp;<strong>Lucas Black's</strong> teenaged drift racer Sean Boswell has found an interesting niche within the fandom and was later worked into the overall plot structure rather than simply being kicked to the curb. The hothead and trouble-maker with a gift for street racing and a knack for auto mechanics is a familiar character in this franchise, but Sean provides an added, exotic wrinkle to the whole thing.</p><p>Before he ever ends up in Tokyo, Sean crashes his car during a drag race, one that he entered to impress a girl and save his pride. While everyone survives the wreck, Sean is arrested, only to be bailed out by his mother.

With Sean as Han's new errand boy, he starts living in his garage as he polishes his drifting skills and starts to get closer to Neela, Takashi's girlfriend. Unfortunately, Han's shady practice of stealing money from his business partners lands all of them in hot water; Takashi and his friends soon give chase to Han, Sean, Neela, and Sean's friend Twinkie. During the chase, they crash, but Han intervenes to keep them safe.

Neela calms things by going with Takashi instead. Sean plans to talk to Takashi's uncle, a true Yakuza, return the money Han stole, and try to settle their differences in a final drift race. Sean is able to win against all odds by using the engine from Han's car installed in his father's 1967 Ford Mustang Fastback. However, the new Drift King already has an admirer, and someone who considers Han friendly wants to meet with him... Sean meets with Dominic Toretto, who's driving a car he won from Han in a race years ago.

She's passed around from car to car to keep the device from locking in on her, buying her enough time to hack it. Thanks to Hobbs taking out the drone, she's finally able to access the God's Eye.

Most of her screentime includes technobabble alongside Tej and even Deckard as they attempt to track down Cipher and Dom. Ramsey does, however, question Dom's loyalty to the team, which puts her on Letty's shit list, though nothing comes of this. A "hacker battle" between Ramsey and Cipher buys the team some time when the cyberterrorist attempts to hijack the Russian sub and its nukes, but ultimately it comes down to horsepower and firepower.</p><p>Ramsey does get a brief love triangle tease, however, with herself, Roman and Tej.

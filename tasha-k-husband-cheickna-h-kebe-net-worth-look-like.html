My husband and I at the ages of 12 & 13. Who would have known that a Malian Boy was being raised to love a poor & broken little girl from Panama City, Florida? Who would have known that we would be raising two beautiful kids together as best friends? I love me some him<span class="pq6dq46d tbxw36s4 knj5qynh kvgmc6g5 ditlmg2l oygrvhab nvdbi5me sf5mxxl7 gl3lb2sf hhz5lgdu">“</span></p><p>Their oldest daughter’s name is Tantou.

Just saw her recent live stream and this time I didn’t say “She needs to get her ass beat”. Normally she and Cheetoh Changa are neck and neck.</p><p>The user further added, “It’s weird. In this video, I saw her swat away her African husband and get busy as a black woman could. She gave Sage advice (I know, I know. I said this shit is weird!) unexpectedly while she read a question that I’m still not sure whether or not she wrote herself. I don’t know but I’m kinda feeling like maybe she deserves the attention ala, Wendy Williams. The girl ain’t stupid. This quarantine is helping all these heaux get great, honestly.”</p><p>She ended her tea writing, “But anyway, Perhaps she gets to flip the switch on celebrities that use the press in THEIR favor ALL DAY. They can’t be mad when she’s clever enough to do the SAME thing and get away with this sh*t. Lord knows I’ve wanted to beat the bricks off her ass on behalf of celebrities I don’t even know. Iono, I think she MAY deserve the attention she gets and she’s way smarter than everyone thinks. In the video, I think it shows a lot about who she Truly is Not sure I have enough respect but it’s interesting to watch.”</p><p>A few started the thread and left some degrading comments.</p><h3><strong>Tasha K Husband Cheickna H Kebe Has HIV?</strong></h3><p>No, Tasha K’s husband Cheickna Kebe doesn’t have HIV.

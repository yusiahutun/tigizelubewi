So I did. People liked me, they thought I was very charming and sweet. And I won.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After winning the title, Lee did a lot of community work such as visiting the elderly and “signing autographs”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I was only 16. But still I never had that mentality of being a superstar because my goal in life is to become a doctor. It still is and always will be because my mother was a very successful doctor.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee’s seventh solo album, Each Time I Think of You was an immediate commercial success when it was released in June, selling more than 300,000 copies in the first week.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">A look back at Coco Lee: from her first taste of fame to singing at the Oscars</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her record company, Sony Music, plans to release her second English-language album, CoCo’s Party, globally at the end of this year. It was released in Taiwan last year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee - who speaks English, Cantonese and Putonghua - has always had her eyes on the music market in the West, especially the United States where she now lives. “My goal in the singing business is not to stay in one place. My goal is to go beyond [Asia] to the US.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“That is why, for CoCo’s Party, I worked with Mariah Carey’s producer, Walter Afanasieff who wrote my first single, It’s a Party.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He is very cool and down-to-earth. He said to me: ‘CoCo, your voice has no nationality . . . you have a great voice, so take care of it.’ He was the one who really helped me out with New York Sony.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hopefully, I will be the first Chinese to release an American album. If it is released, it will be in 1998 or 1999. It will be a while but it is very positive for us.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite plans to conquer international music and the fact that she might be “taking some time off Asia”, Lee still regards this region as her home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/07/07/69a678fd-904e-4e2d-8e92-de185c0c4f68_17ef17c2.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After graduating from high school in 1993, Lee visited Hong Kong and entered the TVB New Talent Singing Contest “just for fun”. Lee came second in the contest with her entry, Run to You, a hit for Whitney Houston. “I was 18 and supposed to go back to school. But I also had an opportunity to be a singer and I asked myself what I should do,” says Lee, whose two sisters work in Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Her mother told her: “‘If it’s no good and if you find this business terrible and the people horrible, then just go back to school.’ So I went along with it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What followed certainly took the young singer by surprise. She was given one line to sing in the hit song Hot Sensational La La La, also in 1993, and it was on the strength of this one line that a Taiwanese record company became interested.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I felt very lucky that because of that one single line, the Taiwan audience liked me a lot, they thought I was very cute and had a very high voice. It was one of those things that remained in their minds for a long time,” she says. Lee’s first solo album, Love Now, was released in June 1994 and the single I Am Still Your Lover won her the accolade of Best New Artist: “I thought that was the biggest encouragement for me to try even harder in the business.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike most teenage idol singers, Lee has a powerful vocal and strong sense of rhythm. Also, what sets her apart is her ability to sing traditional Chinese songs in other styles such as R&B.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/07/06/clean-thumb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">03:59</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Hong Kong music icon Coco Lee dies aged 48 after suicide attempt, sisters say</p><p>Hong Kong music icon Coco Lee dies aged 48 after suicide attempt, sisters say</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I used a lot of ad libs at the beginning, or I just changed some melodies when I was doing the chorus, which to [the local audience] was an irregular ... style and they liked it.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The only possible thing Lee sees holding back her career is her inability to write music. She was not involved in any of the production or songwriting for the Cantonese album, “which is too bad because I have a lot of music in me I want to write. I guess they want to save it for later. A singer should save a lot of space for improvement.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Speaking of her musical influences, Lee says she likes George Michael because his voice is sexy and full of feeling: “If I am doing my homework and I hear him, I’ll stop and listen.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Singer Coco Lee deserves official recognition in Hong Kong, sister says</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He has a very charismatic voice. Let’s say you don’t hear the words, but the voice itself is telling a story.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A querulous pause greets the invitation to name any Hong Kong singing inspirations: “I am sure there are a lot of great ones but they are not my inspiration. Possibly some old ones like Jenny Tseng, Alan Tam Wing-lun and Elisa Chan Kit-ling. They know what singing is all about.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee does not see herself as yet another teenage pop idol, another commercial product created by her record company. She believes she is an idol because young people warm to her healthy image.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I want to be well rounded, I want to be able to do a lot of things, maybe starring in a movie or do a lot of commercials, which I did, and just be multi-talented.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For now, Lee has to continue her studies as well as keep up with her music career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/07/06/clean-thumb.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I don’t like to waste time. In Taiwan, an artist releases two albums a year and it is summer and winter for me. So for the rest of the time I have to do things.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I can’t just sit around at home watching TV. I have to go back to school, to learn, to gain more knowledge and to get smart.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I studied for a year and did very well, and now I had to take time off for the Cantonese album.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But I am returning to college towards the end of next year.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In her studies, Lee wants to specialise on finding a cure for cancer. She expects her medical training to take another decade before she becomes a fully qualified surgeon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am a Capricorn and I don’t have many goals, but if I set goals I will fulfil them.

Besides her professional engagements, she gained more fame in the year 2011.</p><p>This was due to her public and protracted divorce case with her then-husband, Nurdian Cuaca. She is a famous socialite and she has attended numerous fashionable social gatherings.</p><p>The list also includes the annual ICON Ball. In the year 2019, she received an award for being one of the best-dressed attendees at the event.</p><p>The socialite is also a familiar face at international fashion conventions including the Paris Fashion Week. Talking about her career in modeling, she started her journey in this field at the young age of 15 years old.</p><p>This famous personality chose to model over other jobs as it was the best-paying part-time job she could get as a secondary school student.</p><h4><span>More…</span></h4><p>To be a certified professional model, she had to attend classes at Mannequin Studio.</p><p>This required payments that added up to about $800 Singapore dollars. Her parents initially disapproved as they saw it as a waste of money.</p><p>However, her parents eventually lent her the required amount. For the next two years, she spent most of her after-school time auditioning and modeling.</p><p>They were for advertisements and photoshoots. She eventually made enough to pay her parents back as well as acquire her first designer item. It was a $2,000 Chanel bag.</p><p>At the young age of 17 years old, she then joined Singapore Airlines (SIA). She worked with SIA as an air stewardess.</p><p>She worked with SIA for three years and ended her career here when she married Nurdian Cuaca.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-114496 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jamie-Chua-posing-for-a-photo-with-her-collection-of-Manolo-Blahnik-shoes.jpg alt="Jamie Chua" width=650 height=812 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-114496 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jamie Chua posing for a photo with her collection of Manolo Blahnik shoes. Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=Business_Ventures>Business Ventures</span></h2><p>Jamie Chua founded&nbsp;Luminous1 working alongside Sharon Tang in the year 2015. They created this company to provide high-quality beauty care products at affordable prices.</p><p>This brand launched five products with price points ranging from $79 to $439. As of February 2020, the company’s official website is no longer accessible. The company’s social media pages are all inactive as well.</p><p>Similarly, she also co-founded “The Closet Raider” with Sharon Tang in the year 2014.</p><p>This creation aimed to help people find new homes for their designer items. The company then created an accessible online platform to fulfill that goal.</p><p>Despite being a new entrant to the competitive market, her business rapidly gained popularity in Singapore.</p><p>A month after setting up the business, the company earned over 13,000 followers on its Instagram page. However, as of January 2020, the company is struck off.</p><p>Furthermore, her love for Manolo Blahnik shoes inspired her to establish “Cloud 9 Lifestyle” in the year 2006.</p><p>It was a subsidiary of D’League. Her then-husband Nurdian Cuaca owned a substantial portion of the company’s shares.</p><h4><span>Further</span></h4><p>Likewise, she also opened her first retail shop in the year 2007. This was at the Hilton Hotel Shopping Gallery. This company became the first to sell Manolo Blahnik shoes in both Singapore and Southeast Asia.</p><p>The success of the shop prompted her to open another outlet at Marina Bay Sands. However, D’League decided to stop funding Cloud 9 Lifestyle.</p><p>Due to the potential cash-flow problems for the firm, she filed for provisional liquidation in the year 2011. This resulted in the shutting down of both stores following the closure of the company.</p><h2><span id=Divorce_with_Nurdian_Cuaca>Divorce with Nurdian Cuaca</span></h2><p>Although her ex-husband, Nurdian, is a business tycoon at present, it was not the case when they got married.</p><p>Her ex-husband was only an employee at a company. The couple struggled for ten years before Nurdian struck it rich.</p><p>Then in February 2010, Jamie Chua filed for divorce. Back then, the couple had been married for over 15 years. She cited ‘unreasonable behavior’ as the reason for their divorce.</p><p>In response, Nurduan opposed her divorce grounds and countersued for divorce on his grounds. The divorce proceedings were thrust into the public spotlight.</p><p>This was because she was asking for $450,000 Singapore dollars monthly alimony from her ex-husband.</p><p>During the divorce, her ex-husband allegedly canceled her supplementary credit card. The business tycoon had also reduced her monthly maintenance fee.</p><p>Her ex-husband also transferred $3.2 million over two days from a Singapore bank account to an Indonesian account.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-114502 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jamie-Chua-posing-for-a-photo-with-her-children.jpg alt="Jamie Chua" width=650 height=812 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-114502 class=wp-caption-text>Caption:. Jamie Chua posing for a photo with her children. Source: Instagram</p><h4><span>More Details</span></h4><p>As such, she applied to freeze her ex-husband’s $93 million worth of assets. She also applied for an interim maintenance order. However, her ex-husband alleged that the money belonged to his sister.</p><p>But her lawyers argued that it was a calculated move to reduce the assets which would be divided upon their divorce.</p><p>As such, her application for the injunction was successful. The protracted dispute finally ceased on 15 November 2011.</p><p>The freeze on Nurdian Cuaca’s assets was lifted as well. However, the final terms of the arrangement during their divorce were undisclosed.</p><p>In a 2018 interview, she disclosed that she and her ex-husband are on amicable terms. However, the socialite also admitted that the divorce was one of the lowest points in her life.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-114497 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jamie-Chua-posing-for-a-photo-with-her-ex-husband-in-an-old-photograph-1.jpg alt="Jamie Chua" width=650 height=433 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-114497 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Jamie Chua posing for a photo with her ex-husband in an old photograph.

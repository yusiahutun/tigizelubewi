His birth name is Daniel Dwight Tosh. Daniel is originally from West Germany. He later moved to Titusville, Florida while still a child. Dwight is a Marketing degree holder from the University of Central Florida. He got himself a job at the Central Florida Research Park as a telemarketer but decided this is not what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dd1e62f70d54cc1d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Mike Rowe's wife?

In 2013 he was among the top-earning comedians with a net <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">worth of $11 million </a>according to Forbes. More than five years down the line the comedian has accumulated more wealth to his name.

The comedian opted for a silent wedding that was held in Malibu, California and had only a few guests. The April 2016 wedding announced the celeb back into the relationship and dating scene after a controversial period since the breakup with his previous fiancé, Abrigo.</p><h2>Is Tosh gay?</h2><p class=align-left>When it comes to relationships, there have been rumours claiming that Daniel was gay. However, it should be remembered that before the debates of his status, Daniel was once in a straight relationship with actress and model, Megan Abrigo. However, the celeb failed, on various occasions, to come out open regarding his relationship status and whether he has flipped the relationship table to join the LGBT community.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0aca0fc70e4f6549.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Travis Bacon: 7 things you didn't know about Kevin Bacon's son</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Also, in the recent past, he has been a staunch <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">supporter of the LGBT </a>rights and movements, earning himself the acclaim that he could be gay. Besides, Daniel claimed to be in love with a "ballerina," but no one knew whether the "ballerina" was a male or a female. He has remained completely deaf about the question of his new found love. The safest standpoint is that Tosh is happily married and not gay.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Zlatan Ibrahimovic net worth, stats, salary, height, house</p><h2>Tosh's comedy breakthrough</h2><p class=align-left>Tosh's career in comedy began way back in 2001 when he moved to Los Angeles, California in a bid to actively realize his career in comedy.

However, he took part in other performing movies as an actor, with "The Love Guru" <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">starred by Justin Timberlake</a>, Meagan Good, and Jessica Alba only grossing $42 million against the budget of $62 million.</p><h2>Tosh.0 show</h2><p class=align-left>Daniel's career spiralled up the comedy ladder while at Comedy Central, to the extent of launching his show, Tosh.0. The show aired with the Comedy Central since debut and has amassed a net worth of about $16 million since it was started. The show focuses mainly on the review of celebrities, online viral clips, popular culture, and society in general.</p><p class=align-left>Premiered on June 5, 2009, Tosh.0 was a massive success with viewership hitting the 1 million mark per episode, and attracting audiences aged 18-34 years. This is the age group most favourable for advertisers and a reason behind the high valuation. In 2009, the show became one of America's most watched TV shows on the cable network.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/cc405dc5eeb87886.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Eugene Levy net worth 2021: How much does he make on Schitt's Creek?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As of 2016, the show had aired eight seasons, following the 2015 period when the show was sold into syndication. Later on, Tosh.0 began airing in local markets and local stations around the US during the late night slot. The success of Tosh.0 automatically places Daniel as one of the most valuable comedians in America, and one of the most followed celebrities attracting <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">25 million followers </a>on Twitter alone, based on data from September 2016.</p><p class=align-left>Despite the initial success of the show, as well as Daniel performing in different sold-out tours, he didn't perceive himself as a great comedian. In 2016, he threatened to kill himself or quit if he didn't hit the apex of his ambitions as a comedian. In the said time, Tosh was receiving estimated annual earnings of $11 million, according to Forbes magazine.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Luis Suarez's wife, children, career, net worth</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d2eb9f4c65019f6e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>David Rubulotta: What you need to know about Erin Burnett's husband</span></p></a><h2>Daniel Tosh house</h2><p class=align-left>Daniel Tosh owns a stately home located in Redondo Beach, California.

We use these words to describe other people all the time. We can refer to someone as having a positive or negative attitude. We’re actually using these terms to describe a collection of behaviour that someone else is displaying. Other people will use these terms to describe our actions in the same way that we use them to describe other individuals. If we want people to describe us as having a positive attitude, we must exhibit the appropriate behaviours. Our actions will discriminate between positive and bad attitudes. However, it is difficult to classify someone’s attitude as good or negative. People have a favourable attitude towards some things and a negative attitude towards others. This depends on a person’s goals, motivation factors, ability, self-belief, financial status, and opportunity.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Positive Vs. Negative People:</h5><p>The distinction between positive and negative people is summed up in their attitudes. The difference we perceive is in their demeanour as much as their acts. The distinction is between a negative reaction and a positive action. When someone decides to respond adversely to a circumstance, they tend to look back on the problem and become so concentrated on the problem that they can’t move forwards. When someone chooses to respond positively to a situation, they tend to shift into action or solution mode. They acknowledge that they cannot change the past, and hence the problem, but they can affect what happens ahead.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Here are some examples of distinguishing features between positive and negative people:</h5><p><strong>1) Negative:</strong> I will always fail, no matter how hard I try.<br><strong>Positive:</strong> what is the risk of failing? Failure is an essential component of learning something in life.</p><p><strong>2) Negative:</strong> despite my best efforts, I fall short of my goals.<br><strong>Positive:</strong> I will always give my all to reach my objectives.</p><p><strong>3) Negative:</strong> She’s always lecturing everyone.<br><strong>Positive: </strong>She has an inspiring personality and is always eager to assist others.</p><p><strong>4) Negative:</strong> I have already given it my all. At this point, there is nothing further I can do.<br><strong>Positive: </strong>I gave it my all, but there is always space for improvement. What can I do better?</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>What’s The Difference In Their Mindset?</h5><h6 class=wp-block-heading>1) Reaction To Failure:</h6><p>Positive people see failure as a chance to learn and grow. They recognise that failure is an occurrence that does not define who they are. Failure emotionally disables negative people because they allow it to define who they are. They don’t realise it’s all part of the learning and growing process.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>2) Challenges:</h6><p>Positive people enjoy being challenged. They recognise that there can be no growth without difficulty. Positive people welcome challenges and look for methods to overcome them. Negative folks choose the easy way out. They avoid impediments like the plague since they raise the likelihood of failure. Hard times, according to negative people, do not make you, but rather break you.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>3) Perfectionism:</h6><p>Positive folks put up their best effort regardless of the circumstances. They recognise that there are many things over which they have no control, but effort is not one of them. The positive person always gives their best effort, even if it isn’t much. Negative individuals want things to be simple for them. If they have to work hard, they will assume they aren’t good at it and will give up. They are more likely to give them all if they are aware that others are watching them.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>4) Know-It-All:</h6><p>Positive folks enjoy learning. They recognise that information evolves and that what worked ten years ago may no longer be useful today. Negative people assume they know everything, and they are less likely to embrace fresh knowledge that challenges their beliefs. They are more concerned with who is right than with what is right.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>Health And Well Being:</h6><p>According to a growing amount of studies, maintaining an optimistic mindset can help your physical health. Scientists supported by the nih are striving to better understand the connections between your mindset and your body. They’re finding some evidence that mastering particular abilities can promote emotional wellbeing.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>People holding positive attitude experience several health benefits such as:</h6><li>Increased life expectancy</li><li>Lower depression rates</li><li>Reduced misery and discomfort and greater resistance to illnesses</li><li>Improved psychological and physical health</li><li>Better cardiovascular health and a lower chance of death from heart disease and stroke</li><li>Cancer death risk is reduced.</li><li>Lower chance of death from respiratory diseases</li><li>Reduced risk of infection-related death</li><li>Improved coping abilities through adversity and stress</li><h6 class=wp-block-heading>People holding negative attitude experience negative health symptoms such as:</h6><li>Chronic stress</li><li>Body’s hormone imbalance</li><li>Depletion of the brain chemicals essential for happiness, and affects the immune system.</li><li>Stress shortens our telomeres, the “end caps” of our DNA strands, causing us to age faster.)</li><li>Hypertension (high blood pressure)</li><li>Cardiovascular illness</li><li>Digestive difficulties</li><li>Infection.</li><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Interpersonal Relationships:</h5><p>People with positive attitudes have good interpersonal relationships at family and work in comparison to people with negative attitudes. People with positive attitudes have feelings of unity and cooperation, they approach each task with a can-do mindset. They hold the capability to solve each problem by communicating. Communication is extremely essential for long-lasting relationships. However, people with negative attitudes want to change the outcome without changing themselves. They have poor communication skills and do not believe in unity and cooperation which results in conflicts.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Coping Mechanisms</h5><h6 class=wp-block-heading>Positive Attitude:</h6><li><strong>Positive Reframing:</strong> They Tend To Reframe Negative Situations Into Positive Ones.</li><li><strong>Optimism: </strong>They Remain Resilient In The Face Of Adversity.</li><li><strong>Seeking Support:</strong> They Seek Social Support Of Friends And Family Whenever They Are In Trouble.</li><li><strong>Gratitude:</strong> They Give Less Excuses About Things In Life. They Always Have A Heart Full Of Gratitude.</li><h6 class=wp-block-heading>Negative Attitude:</h6><li><strong>Avoidance: </strong>They Tend To Put All Things Under The Carpet And Do Not Confront Challenges.</li><li><strong>Denial: </strong>They Occasionally Deny The Severity Of The Problems.</li><li><strong>Blame:</strong> They Engage In Blame Shifting, Pointing Fingers At Others. They Never See Themselves As A Victim To A Problem.</li><li><strong>Escapism:</strong> These People Engage In Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms Such As Binge Drinking, Substance Abuse, and Binge Drinking.</li><h6 class=wp-block-heading>Importance Of Positive Attitude:</h6><ul><li>Broaden Our Worldview (Thereby Motivating Greater Creativity, Wonder, And Options)</li><li>Build Throughout Time To Achieve Long-Term Emotional Resilience And Flourishing.</li></ul><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Forgiveness And Positive Attitude:</h5><p>Forgiveness entails totally acknowledging that a negative incident occurred and letting go of our negative sentiments about the situation.&nbsp; According to research, forgiveness improves our mental, emotional, and physical well-being. And it is something that can be learnt, as proved by the stanford forgiveness project, which trained 260 individuals in forgiveness over the course of six weeks.</p><ul><li>70% reported a lessening in their hurt feelings.</li><li>13% reported less anger.</li><li>27% reported less bodily problems (such as discomfort, stomach distress, dizziness, and so on).</li></ul><p>Forgiveness has also been related to improved immune function and a longer lifespan. Other research has found that forgiveness has more than a metaphorical effect on the heart: it can actually lower our blood pressure and improve our<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> cardiovascular health</a>.</p><h5 class=wp-block-heading>How To Cultivate A Positive Attitude:</h5><li><strong>Make Yourself Happy: </strong>The Mind Is A Tremendous Tool. If You Allow Yourself To Maintain A Happy Outlook, Your Attitude Will Follow.</li><li><strong>Pay Attention To Your Inner Monologue:</strong> When Confronted With A Bad Notion, Transform It Into A Positive Thought.</li><li><strong>Interact With Positive People And In Positive Settings:</strong> Do Things With Individuals Who Positively Encourage You.

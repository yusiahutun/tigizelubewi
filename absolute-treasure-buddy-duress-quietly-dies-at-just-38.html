Stathis) who was cast alongside Robert Pattinson in the 2017 film, ‘quietly died’ from a ‘drug cocktail’, his family has said. Buddy Duress’ death comes as a shock to the showbiz industry as he passed away before Thanksgiving, but the news is only coming out now. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> battled drug use, which he said in some way led him to the silver screen. A <a href=#>Hollywood</a> director has come out to mourn his friend, and called him an “amazing talent”.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-buddy-duress-death-confirmed-by-his-brother>Buddy Duress’ death confirmed by his brother</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-827965660-683x1024.jpg><p>His brother, Christopher Duress, said Buddy (who also went by Mike) passed away in November of last year, but his death is only just being announced.</p><p>Friend Jay Karales paid tribute to the film star on X (<a href=#>Twitter</a>).</p><p>He said: “This man was an absolute treasure. Without a doubt, Buddy Duress was one of the most entertaining people I’ve ever met and his stories were unrivaled.</p><p>“I remember seeing him in Good Time in 2017 and saying, ‘That is what the future of acting needs to be. That guy,'” he continued.</p><p>“He brought a certain authenticity and charisma to the screen that you just don’t see anymore.</p><p>“It was a dream to get him in Mass State Lottery, and I feel privileged to have been his director and his friend.”</p><p>Buddy died from a “cardiac arrest from a drug cocktail”, his brother <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> People.</p><p>Buddy also starred in PVT Chat besides <a href=#>Kanye West</a>‘s ex Julia Fox.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-if-i-wasn-t-on-the-run-i-wouldn-t-have-been-in-that-film>‘If I wasn’t on the run, I wouldn’t have been in that film’</h2><p>His career was starting to get off the ground in 2019 when he faced legal issues. Buddy spent time in Rikers Island jail over allegations of grand larceny in the third degree, writes the New York Post.</p><p>He was sent there 10 times on various charges, from heroin possession to identity theft. His mother allegedly turned him in to the police for reportedly stealing checks and forging her signature for $3,000, back in 2019.</p><p>The New York native, born in Queens, was featured in two Safdie Brothers’ indie films, with his big break being Heaven Knows What in 2014. He was given the acting role by Benny and Josh Safdie, having met the latter the year before after being released from prison.</p><p>In 2017, he <a href=# rel=nofollow>explained he was on the run</a> after skipping out on a drug in-patient program and met Josh through a mutual friend. He then landed the role in the flick but was caught by cops and taken back to jail when the film wrapped. Buddy was still behind bars when it premiered at the New York Film Festival.</p><p>He said at the time: “You know, I still look back at it. If I had went to that program, I wouldn’t have been in&nbsp;Heaven Knows What, and I probably wouldn’t be an actor right now. That’s the honest truth. I wouldn’t.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-his-time-in-prison-became-a-film>His time in prison became a film</h2><p>The LA Times <a href=# rel=nofollow>reports</a> when he was released, the brothers asked him to write a journal about his time behind bars. They then adapted his journal into a script for Good Time, that featured <a href=#>Twilight star Robert Pattinson</a>.</p><p>In 2017, they began filming the indie flick, and Buddy went on to star in more films. This included The Mountain, 86’d, and The Great Darkened Days.</p><p>Two years later, while filming Flinch, the star was arrested for threatening to burn his mother Jo-Anne’s house down, writes the Post. His mom and director, Cameron Van Hoy, bailed him out, but he was arrested again and taken back to Rikers for charges of menacing and criminal possession of brass knuckles and a controlled substance.</p><p>He then was cast in Funny Pages, Alone and The New Rich Family Grudge.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-was-pure-electricity-on-screen>‘He was pure electricity on screen’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-829306062-1024x683.jpg><p>Van Hoy has paid tribute to the star, telling People: “Buddy was pure electricity on screen.</p><p>“Working with him was one of the great adventures of my life. He was a kind person who loved making films. Despite any troubles he was going through in life he somehow managed to put them aside when it came time to work. We grew quite close after the production of our film&nbsp;Flinch.</p><p>“I’m heartbroken that his life came to an end as it did.”</p><p>Mass State Lottery director Jay Karales said: “Buddy Duress was a once in a lifetime charismatic actor and a genuinely humble man that left an impression on everyone he met. I was extremely fortunate to be able to direct him and get to know him off-set during our time shooting&nbsp;Mass State Lottery.</p><p>“What happened is a tragic and frustrating loss of visceral talent.</p><p>“He lived like a cowboy and carrying the weight of that kind of life informed his skills and performances in a way that made him irreplaceable as an actor. He has unfortunately become the John Cazale of our generation.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-can-t-believe-buddy-duress-death>Fans can’t believe Buddy Duress’ death</h2><p>A lot of fans took to social media as well as forums such as Reddit to talk about the shocking news.</p><p>Some gave their condolences, others wrote tributes and a few users couldn’t believe they were only finding out about Buddy Duress’ death now, three months later.</p><p>“Man he was my favorite part in Good Time. May he rest in peace,” one fan wrote online.</p><p>“This is crazy. He’s a good actor. What a shame. May he rest in peace,” a second added.</p><p>“He would’ve gone so far man. Rest in Peace,” echoed another.</p><p>“Rest in peace, he was great in Good Time and in PVT Chat as well. Very sad,” one mourned.</p><p><strong>If you’ve been affected by this story you can contact American Addiction Centers on (877) 686-7688 or Talk To Frank on 0300 123 6600 in the UK.</strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2eFcK3BrKalraSaerW%2BxJqqrqqVYq%2B2sMOyZJ2toprAtHnQrqCerJyueqW1xKxkmqxdn8K0wIxsb2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fabsolute-treasure-buddy-duress-quietly-dies-at-just-38.html&text=%27Absolute%20treasure%27%20Buddy%20Duress%20%27quietly%20dies%27%20at%20just%2038&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fabsolute-treasure-buddy-duress-quietly-dies-at-just-38.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fabsolute-treasure-buddy-duress-quietly-dies-at-just-38.html&title=%27Absolute%20treasure%27%20Buddy%20Duress%20%27quietly%20dies%27%20at%20just%2038" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fabsolute-treasure-buddy-duress-quietly-dies-at-just-38.html&title=%27Absolute%20treasure%27%20Buddy%20Duress%20%27quietly%20dies%27%20at%20just%2038" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fabsolute-treasure-buddy-duress-quietly-dies-at-just-38.html&title=%27Absolute%20treasure%27%20Buddy%20Duress%20%27quietly%20dies%27%20at%20just%2038" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fabsolute-treasure-buddy-duress-quietly-dies-at-just-38.html&description=%27Absolute%20treasure%27%20Buddy%20Duress%20%27quietly%20dies%27%20at%20just%2038" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cleanfluencers-what-is-it-and-how-to-become-one.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cleanfluencers: What Is It and How to Become One">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./spacex-falcon-9-booster-completes-record.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="SpaceX Falcon 9 Booster Completes Record-Breaking 18th Flight">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

It’s about going out of your comfort zone (leaving home or getting a new roommate), sharing close bonds and responsibilities with completely new people, an increase of expectations, and much more.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>What is a happy marriage?</h4><p>A happy marriage is subjective.

Some of such principles are below mentioned:</p><li><strong>Respecting and understanding individuality: Rejecting patterns of </strong>irritation expectations and being ready to be rejected.</li><li><strong>Unconditional support:</strong> Give each other unconditional support in the time of adversity.</li><li><strong>Empathetic Relationship: </strong>empathizing with each other’s struggles and challenges they are facing in their life.</li><li><strong>Respecting each other:</strong> Respecting each other even when fighting, means not saying anything too personal to them. Also not take hurtful comments personally.</li><li><strong>Understanding Each Other: </strong>understanding each other needs and having the intention to fulfill them.</li><li><strong>Treating with dignity: </strong>In social settings or in family treating your partner in a way that shows the value of their role and character.</li><li><strong>Value for money and time: </strong>Using each other’s money wisely.

Yes, people may have bad days, but the memories of those bad days vanish with time and love takes charge over pain. A happy marriage is a balance of self-love and partner love. Being too close to each other can also create disturbance in relationships. So it is important that from time to time they take a break from each other. After the break, they can feel a sense of joy once again.</p><h6 class=wp-block-heading>Best books to read for a happy married life:</h6><h6 class=wp-block-heading></h6><span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Relationship</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Equity Theory: Balancing of Inputs and Outputs</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 30, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Relationship</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Self Help</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Role of Empathy in Building a Meaningful Relationship</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 21, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Relationship</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Understanding and Overcoming Fear of Intimacy</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 2, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Relationship</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Psychology of Romance</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>April 1, 2024 <span class=entry-categories><a href=# rel="category tag">Positive</a>, <a href=# rel="category tag">Relationship</a></span><h4 class="entry-title title-animation-black-normal"><a href=#>Is Your Partner Emotionally Unavailable? 7 Signs to</a></h4><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i>March 18, 2024<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sb%2FYnJ%2BopJ%2BcwG%2BvzqZmqaupmLWwuM6gsGaalZ22r7CMoZipqKliuqK%2B0aKYoJ2jZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpsychology-behind-happy-marriages.html&text=Psychology%20Behind%20Happy%20Marriages&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpsychology-behind-happy-marriages.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpsychology-behind-happy-marriages.html&title=Psychology%20Behind%20Happy%20Marriages" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpsychology-behind-happy-marriages.html&title=Psychology%20Behind%20Happy%20Marriages" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpsychology-behind-happy-marriages.html&title=Psychology%20Behind%20Happy%20Marriages" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpsychology-behind-happy-marriages.html&description=Psychology%20Behind%20Happy%20Marriages" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./66132fa546163f881c8b456f-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Resultados del Melate: nmeros ganadores sorteo 3884 domingo 7 de abril 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./new-concert-venue-radius-to-open-in-chicago-next-year.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="New Concert Venue Radius To Open In Chicago Next Year">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

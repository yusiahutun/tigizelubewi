It got to the point where she underwent more than a dozen surgeries in her desperate attempt to resemble the 42-year-old.</strong></p><p>In 2016, when she was 33, Tiffany Taylor was a proud Trump supporter, but she idolized his daughter Ivanka more than the former President of the United States. When asked why she wants to change her look, she explained Ivanka was: “Elegant, classy, she represents women, she’s a go-getter, and she’s positive.” Tiffany was featured on TV for her obsession of wanting to look like Ivanka, undergoing 13 surgeries or procedures in just one year. But it wasn’t enough. A few months later, she contacted <a href=#>TV</a> show Botched, to help her dream become reality.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meet-tiffany-taylor-the-woman-who-wanted-to-look-like-ivanka-trump>Meet Tiffany Taylor – the woman who wanted to look like Ivanka Trump</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-29-at-11.51.13-1024x590.png><p>The Texan, who originally <a href=# rel=nofollow>spoke</a> to Nightline, listed the long list of plastic surgery visits she’s had at the beginning of her journey. Tiffany had her breasts done to receive D implants, as well as undergoing changes to her nose.</p><p>She further explained: “Injections in my cheeks and a mini eye lift, a tiny bit, not too much. I also had liposuction and I think I had fat grafts in my cheeks a little bit.”</p><p>She was then filmed visiting Houston-based specialist, Dr Franklin Rose, for another procedure. The surgeon said at the time, more people were coming forward to look like the former advisor. He explained Tiffany Taylor wasn’t the first person to come in “with a picture of Ivanka Trump”.</p><p>During her appointment, she received more cheek fillers. The next day, she had an eyelid lift and a second nose job.</p><p>When asked what she’d say to haters, she said: “Don’t judge until you try it”.</p><p>The mom-of-three event tried to adopt Ivanka’s classic style, shopping for a new look the next morning.</p><p>Nothing was off-limits if it meant Tiffany was a step closer to her dreams.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-came-back-for-more-surgeries>She came back for more surgeries</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/Screenshot-2024-01-29-at-11.54.12-1024x579.png><p>But she didn’t stop there, because in 2017 she was featured on E!’s Botched.</p><p>The oil and gas consultant wanted to meet the famous Dr Terry Dubrow and Paul Nassif to see if they can do any improvements to push Tiffany Taylor closer to being Ivanka Trump.</p><p>When she arrived, she definitely adopted the look of <a href=#>Donald Trump</a>‘s daughter. Tiffany wore a black and pink stylish dress with a string of large pearls.</p><p>“I’m here today, because this is what I represent to the world and it’s gotta be perfection,” she explained to the doctors.</p><p>However, it seems her efforts so far had failed. Because the two specialists asked Tiffany Taylor the all-important question of what <a href=#>celebrity</a> she’s trying to look like, and she says “Ivanka Trump”. The awkward part is that the doctors’ can’t hide their shocked reactions. The fact they needed to ask her at all may prove her surgeries so far didn’t actually seal the deal.</p><p>Dr Dubrow confesses in a separate cut: “Tiffany doesn’t really look like Ivanka Trump. She’s more like an Ivanna [Trump]. Ivanna thinks she looks like Ivanka Trump – but she doesn’t”.</p><p>Ouch.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-doctors-concerned-over-her-past>Doctors concerned over her past</h2><p>When Tiffany asks Dr Nassif why he looks ‘serious’, he says: “I’m pondering this conversation for a minute, trying to figure out why would you do that much of a transformation that quick.”</p><p>Dr Dubrow chimes in: “Are you married?”</p><p>“No. I was married for 10 years, but no, I’m single,” she replies.</p><p>That’s when Dr Dubrow continued: “How long after you broke up did you start having these surgeries?”</p><p>She explained: “Four to months.”</p><p>This sent alarm bells ringing in the surgeons’ minds.</p><p>“It’s very common for people, after a traumatic event, or a breakup, to come in and want to have plastic surgery,” Dubrow tells the camera in a confessional. “But you have to be very careful of those individuals, if they’re doing it for the right reasons and don’t have unrealistic expectations. That can be a real red flag.”</p><p>Despite their concerns, the doctors did examine Tiffany to talk about the problems she had with her forehead, brows, eyes and bump in her nose. They manage to talk her out of the nose job, by explaining having another surgery after just four months since the last one would be bad news. She’s then told, to remove the ‘red incision line’ for her latest eye lift, it can just be removed with a laser procedure.</p><p>Dr Dubrow had some last words of wisdom for Taylor: “My advice to Tiffany is to forget about Ivanka Trump. Go home, relax, take a beat, and maybe think about doing this sometime in the future.”</p><p>“Maybe, I don’t know, in four years,” he joked – referring to the presidential election.</p><p>He added: “Tiffany doesn’t need to be made great again”.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eGcMDIn52apqliwaLFy6iprGWfl8Cmv9Kipqdlp57BqXnIr5ino5FiwbPBzKlkpZ2UYsGweZBsZKytopyys7XErGSipl2ku6Z52J6Yq2c%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftiffany-taylors-obsession-with-ivanka-trump-led-to-13-surgeries-in-one-year.html&text=Tiffany%20Taylor%27s%20obsession%20with%20Ivanka%20Trump%20led%20to%2013%20surgeries%20in%20one%20year&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftiffany-taylors-obsession-with-ivanka-trump-led-to-13-surgeries-in-one-year.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftiffany-taylors-obsession-with-ivanka-trump-led-to-13-surgeries-in-one-year.html&title=Tiffany%20Taylor%27s%20obsession%20with%20Ivanka%20Trump%20led%20to%2013%20surgeries%20in%20one%20year" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftiffany-taylors-obsession-with-ivanka-trump-led-to-13-surgeries-in-one-year.html&title=Tiffany%20Taylor%27s%20obsession%20with%20Ivanka%20Trump%20led%20to%2013%20surgeries%20in%20one%20year" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftiffany-taylors-obsession-with-ivanka-trump-led-to-13-surgeries-in-one-year.html&title=Tiffany%20Taylor%27s%20obsession%20with%20Ivanka%20Trump%20led%20to%2013%20surgeries%20in%20one%20year" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftiffany-taylors-obsession-with-ivanka-trump-led-to-13-surgeries-in-one-year.html&description=Tiffany%20Taylor%27s%20obsession%20with%20Ivanka%20Trump%20led%20to%2013%20surgeries%20in%20one%20year" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./heartbroken-kate-garraway-issues-update-31558244.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Heartbroken' Kate Garraway issues update on husband Derek after being rushed to hospital">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./maison-francis-kurkdjian-perfume.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 10 Best Maison Francis Kurkdjian Perfumes in 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

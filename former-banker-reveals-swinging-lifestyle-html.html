All our lives, we are taught that jealousy is a natural response and that we're supposed to respond to our partner doing anything outside of our relationship with envy. Jealousy therefore becomes an accepted behavior.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When you switch to a swinging lifestyle, you have to retrain your brain and there's a few simple steps to get you to that place. In a nutshell, jealousy is a fear of something - a fear that your partner will like someone more than you/ and leave you for someone else or maybe that the person your partner is with will be better in bed. Walk and talk your way through your fears and figure out exactly what is bothering you. After that, it's important to communicate those fears to your partner and work through them together.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In life, we often allow our fear to dictate how we view the situation instead of testing our fears to see if they're in fact real.</p><img id=i-a1507d7949f8a284 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/14/16/41683EB900000578-4602542-Jackie_says_the_most_common_question_I_receive_is_how_to_deal_wi-a-3_1497455712914.jpg height=391 width=586 alt="Jackie says the most common question I receive is how to deal with jealousy and fear when you open up your relationship and how to handle your partner being in bed with someone else" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Jackie says the most common question I receive is how to deal with jealousy and fear when you open up your relationship and how to handle your partner being in bed with someone else</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Q: DO YOU TELL YOUR PARTNER ALL ABOUT THE OTHER PEOPLE YOU HAVE SEX WITH?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A: ALWAYS share the details of your sexual encounters with your partner. That's part of the inclusion aspect of swinging - even if your husband or wife is not they're physically, include them in your exciting experience by telling them all about it. It brings another aspect to your relationship and strengthens it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I also love watching my husband with another woman and seeing him enjoying someone else's company - it brings us happiness and closer together.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Q: AM I TOO OLD OR NOT ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH TO JOIN THE SWINGERS LIFESTYLE?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A: The answer to that is NO. It's important to remember that the swinging lifestyle is that swingers are just society. They encompass every walk of life, ever demographic, race and physique. I often receive emails from people who are worried that they are overweight or not attractive enough to swing successfully. But swingers are such a broad range of couples and singles. Sure, you will find people who want that uber-fit guy but there will be plenty of others who are looking for that cute teddy bear physique! Of course, if you're not truly happy with your weight, take a look at yourself and see what you can do.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Q: HOW DO YOU ORGANISE A THREESOME SUCCESSFULLY?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A: Typically we organize a threesome online or at swingers event. When you're setting up a profile online, be completely honest if you want to be successful. Be 100% honest about your weight, height and your interests when compiling your description - and include a wide range of photos. Some of the images we include are sexual in nature. But if you're a single man and your pictures wont include a spouse, don't pose only nude photos unless they're true pieces of art! Most women will want to see who you are...not just your genitalia.</p><img id=i-136c534402403ba src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/14/09/41683E9900000578-4602542-Sharing_her_tips_for_embracing_the_lifestyle_she_said_Sign_up_to-a-1_1497429297551.jpg height=379 width=284 alt="Sharing her tips for embracing the lifestyle, she said: 'Sign up to a social dating site and take a look at the scene or attend a newbie swingers night'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Sharing her tips for embracing the lifestyle, she said: 'Sign up to a social dating site and take a look at the scene or attend a newbie swingers night'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When you find an individual or couple online you might like to play with, have a few conversations online and maybe organize a dinner date. We'll often bring people over to house afterwards but don't feel like you have engage with them sexually on the first date. And don't take it personally if you get rejected at a swingers party or an online date - it's often nothing to do with you. Maybe that couple are just not cut out for it that day or not able to perform.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Q: WHAT IS A SWINGERS PARTY REALLY LIKE?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A: It's not as raucous as you think! It took me a while to go my first adult party, I was convinced it was going to be a den of debauchery. But a swingers club is more respectful that a normal nightclub. There's no sex in the toilets and no manhandling.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Couple and individuals have rules about engaging with others so it's not seedy. But there's a great, sexual atmosphere in the air and a lot of people just come to these parties to watch and soak the ambiance up.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Q: WHAT DO I DO IF I SEE A WORK COLLEAGUE AT A SWINGERS PARTY?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A: Don't ignore them. Just go speak to each other - swingers are discreet and neither of you is going to say anything to others about your chance meeting.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Q: HOW DO I CONVINCE MY WIFE TO GET INVOLVED IN THE SWINGERS LIFESTYLE?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A: If your partner is hesitant about opening up your relationship, then give options. Maybe you can attend a swingers club with each other and just soak up the atmosphere. Sign up to a social dating site and take a look at the scene or attend a newbie swingers night. They can help ease any of your wife's fears. But the truth is you can't convince your partner to get involved if they are dead against it. Swinging is about honesty and being committed to creating the best possible relationship with their partner.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-b4aadd303f83881a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/14/16/41683F2E00000578-4602542-Through_her_book_right_Jackie_wants_to_help_and_inform_others_wh-a-4_1497455713176.jpg height=383 width=284 alt="Through her book, right, Jackie wants to help and inform others who felt the same doubts and worries she initially had about opening up her relationship" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img id=i-ab793e0f0d88dfb src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/06/14/08/41683F3700000578-4602542-image-m-49_1497426141647.jpg height=383 width=284 alt="She has now compiled a selection of the most asked and provocative questions in her new book 'Swingers' Lifestyle: The Questions You Are Afraid To Ask'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Through her book, right, Jackie wants to help and inform others who felt the same doubts and worries she initially had about opening up her relationship.

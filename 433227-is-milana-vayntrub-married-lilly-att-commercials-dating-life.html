Milana has done a great job at keeping her relationship life private and away from the media. Although the talented actress has kept a low profile and her love life under wraps, numerous sources claim she is unmarried.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0392214a50593119.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Annamarie Tendler bio: height, net worth, wedding, parents, what happened</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2012, Milana stated that she would love to get married one day and that her husband should be a good cook as she is terrible at cooking.

He went on to star in Australian TV shows like Neighbours,&nbsp;Marshall Law and The Saddle Club before auditioning for the role of Robbie Hunter in the Australian soap opera Home and Away.

The character, who made his debut in the Marvel Comics issue “Journey into Mystery #83” in 1962, is based on the God of the Thunder of the same name from Norse mythology. He’s also an Avenger and the former king of Asgard. Hemsworth went on to reprise his role as Thor in eight more Marvel Cinematic Universe movies: 2012’s The Avengers, 2013’s Thor Dark World, 2015’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, 2016’s Doctor Strange, 2017’s Thor: Ragnarok, 2018’s Avengers: Infinity War, 2019’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Avengers: Endgame</a>, and 2022’s Thor: Love and Thunder.&nbsp;In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Vanity Fair</a> in 2022, Hemsworth opened up about how his career mirrored Thor’s journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “I just love playing the character. I love the journey I have been on with him. Not only as Thor, but just my life. The two have been side by side for 10, 11 years now and have both crossed over into each other’s world from time to time,” he said.</p><p>Despite his positive experience in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Hemsworth also told the magazine that he was “disappointed” in his performance in the second Thor movie, Thor: Dark World. “I wasn’t stoked with what I’d done in Thor 2,” he said. “I was a little disappointed in what I’d done. I didn’t think I grew the character in any way and I didn’t think I showed the audience something unexpected and different.” He also revealed to Vanity Fair that he was “bored” of the character before he had a conversation with Thor: Love and Thunder director, Taika Waititi, about how to tell a story Thor hasn’t told before.&nbsp;“I think the conversation we had was, ‘I’m really bored of Thor,’ and ‘I’m really bored of Thor too!’ Then we decided not to be bored and anytime that feeling came into play we’d go into a different direction,” he said.</p><p>So how much does Hemsworth make from playing Thor?

The last original Avengers actor, Robert Downey Jr. (who plays Iron Man), was paid $50 million for each Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, though some reports claim that he made $200 million for each movie, which would’ve paid him $400 million in total. According to Celebrity Net Worth, Hemsworth earned $75 million in 2018 and 2019, the years Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame were released, ranking him 24th on Forbes’ list of highest-paid celebrities for 2019.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a> in June 2022, Hemsworth hinted that Thor: Love and Thunder may be his last movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. “Well the last [Marvel movie] I shot was Thor: Love and Thunder, and it might be my last Marvel movie, I don’t know,” he said. “It was a wild and fun and wacky experience, as all Taika Waititi movies are. Played that character for ten, eleven, years now, and each time it’s been new and exciting, and this was no exception to that. It felt very fresh and it felt like we were trying something we hadn’t tried before. I was, in Taika’s words, I think a wacky, wild, romantic comedy set in space.” Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, however, told Total Film in June 2022 that he has “many” Thor stories to tell in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and would want Hemsworth to continue as the character to tell them. “I know this: there are many, many other Thor stories in the comics that we talk about a lot. And as we watch Chris Hemsworth continue to grow and evolve as a major acting talent, I would be excited to see how he keeps evolving this complex character,” he said. Hemsworth told the magazine that he’d return as Thor as long as each movie and story is different. “Each time, if the opportunity comes up and presents itself, I’m just open to whatever creative exploration can happen, thanks to different writers and directors and so on,” he said. “But I love playing the character, I really do. It always comes down to: ‘Is this script different to the last one? Are we repeating something?’ And when it becomes too familiar, I think that’s when I’d have to say, ‘Yeah, no, this doesn’t… I think I’ve…'” He continued, “I’d like to exit before people tell me to exit.”</p><p>Hemsworth also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a> in June 2022 that he’ll continue to play until someone tells him to “get off the stage.”&nbsp;“I’ll do it until someone says get off the stage,” he said. “There’s an adolescent quality to him, a sense of adventure. And a sort of fun immaturity.” He continued, “Working with Waititi], it’s something different each time, something fresh. And he’s a dear friend. He has the same sort of immature quality I was talking about. In the best way possible.” Thor: Love and Thunder executive producer Brian Chapek also explained to Deadline that Thor is the first Marvel Cinematic Universe character to have four solo movies, which is a testament to the character. “Well I would say he’s the only person so far to get four movies. That’s not necessarily a hint, but it’s not a restriction either,” he said.</p><h2>What is Chris Hemsworth’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Thor-Ragnarok-2.jpg><p>What is Chris Hemsworth’s net worth?

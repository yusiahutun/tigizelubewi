As a result, a child becomes a caregiver. It makes a child handle all the adult responsibilities even before he/she becomes an adult.&nbsp;The word parentification was given by <strong>Ivan Boszormenyi Nagy </strong>who was an American psychiatrist, which describes what happens when the roles of a child and the parents are reversed. Parentification affects the process of child development and the child’s mental and physical health negatively.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=#>The Basics of Child Psychology</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>According to <strong>Jacinda K. Dariotis, </strong>“Parentification is like increasing the activities that the adults should be doing. The outcomes will be more negative for the children if it starts earlier and lasts longer.” A common example is when a child is told by their relatives that he is the ‘man of the house now’ after his father passes away. After hearing this, a child starts taking this role very seriously and starts worrying about his mother and siblings.&nbsp;</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Studies and Research on Parentification&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>According to the National Alliance for Caregiving approximately 1.4 million children in the United States experience and are experiencing parentification.</li><li>It was found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, children in Poland had to take care of their education when many families experienced illness or job loss.&nbsp;</li><li>A research by Jones and Wells in 1996 found that many children who had grown up very quickly showed characteristics like “people pleasing”.&nbsp;</li><li>DiCaccavo (2005) argues that parentification makes a child a <a href=#>failure</a> as he/she is attempting to perform tasks that are beyond his/her capabilities.&nbsp;</li></ul><h5 class=wp-block-heading>Types of Parentification &nbsp;</h5><p>There are two types of Parentification :&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Instrumental Parentification is when a child is held responsible for the household tasks in the family.&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;cleaning, grocery shopping, paying the bills, cooking etc.</li><li>Emotional Parentification is when a child is held responsible for the emotional tasks in the family.&nbsp;for e.g. taking care of parents, taking care of siblings, listening to parents’ complaints and frustrations, serving as a mediator in parents’ arguments.</li></ul><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Causes of Parentification&nbsp;</h4><p>Parentification can arise from :&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Divorce</li><li>Financial problems</li><li>Parents who were neglected in their childhood&nbsp;</li><li>Depressed parents&nbsp;</li><li>Death of a parent or sibling&nbsp;</li><li>Drug or alcohol addiction&nbsp;</li><li>Disability of parents&nbsp;</li><li>Toxic relationship between parents&nbsp;</li></ul><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Effects of Parentification&nbsp;</h4><p>Parentification leaves lasting effects on a child that remain till adulthood. Some of the effects are:&nbsp;</p><li><strong>Loss of childhood: </strong>One of the biggest effects of parentification is that a child loses his childhood as he/she is forced to grow up very soon. A child struggles to play or have fun after he/she is given the responsibility of the family.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Guilt & Shame: </strong>A child starts believing that it’s his/her fault whenever something bad happens in the family. A child starts thinking that the parents might punish him/her for creating conflicts or misfortunes. Thus, they blame themselves.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Seeing own needs as a burden:</strong> A child might get sensitive to others’ needs and start putting their needs above their own. They might feel like their needs are a burden to them and their family members. Thus, they start neglecting themselves.</li><li><strong>Social Isolation: </strong>A child might lose his real self due to all the responsibilities and end up getting lonely and confused about who they actually are. This continues till adulthood which causes a form of <a href=#>loneliness</a> and social isolation that also creates interpersonal and intrapersonal problems.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Mental Health Issues: </strong>It becomes unhealthy when a child suppresses his/her own needs in front of others, and a child who has experienced parentification experiences <a href=#>anxiety</a>, <a href=#>depression</a>, substance use disorders and other issues.&nbsp;</li><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Signs of Parentification&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>You felt responsible for your siblings or your parents.&nbsp;</li><li>You felt like you had to be the peacekeeper.&nbsp;</li><li>You felt like your family would not make it without you.&nbsp;</li><li>Your childhood lacked the fun that other kids had.&nbsp;</li><li>You were given responsibilities that were not age appropriate.&nbsp;</li><li>You tend to be the caregiver in your <a href=#>relationships</a>&nbsp;</li><li>You felt overworked between school and family responsibilities.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4 class=wp-block-heading>How to Heal From Parentification?</h4><li><strong>Acknowledge the Experience</strong>– Recognize and acknowledge that you were parentified. Unde0rstanding that this was not a typical or healthy childhood experience is the first step towards healing.</li><li><strong>Seek Support</strong>– Find a therapist or counselor who specializes in childhood trauma or family dynamics. Talking to a professional can provide you with the support and guidance you need to work through your experiences. CBT can help a child to change their thought patterns and feelings about themselves that can be helpful in healing them. By listening and getting in touch with the inner self, a child can give himself/herself the things that they did not get in your past.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Set Boundaries</strong>– Learn to set healthy boundaries with your family members or anyone who may still expect you to fulfill a parental role. It’s important to establish your own identity and prioritize your own needs.</li><li><strong>Self-Compassion</strong>– Be gentle with yourself and practice self-compassion. Understand that you were put in a difficult position and did the best you could at the time.</li><li><strong>Reclaim Your Childhood</strong>– Engage in activities or hobbies that bring you joy and allow you to reconnect with your inner child. This can help you experience a sense of freedom and playfulness that may have been lacking during your childhood.</li><li><strong>Develop Healthy Relationships</strong>– Surround yourself with supportive and nurturing relationships. Building healthy connections with others can help counteract the effects of parentification and provide you with the love and care you deserve.</li><li><strong>Therapeutic Techniques</strong>– Explore therapeutic techniques such as inner child work, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) to address any underlying issues and develop coping strategies.</li><li><strong>Educate Yourself</strong>– Educate yourself about parentification and its effects. Understanding how it has impacted your life can empower you to make positive changes and break free from unhealthy patterns.</li><li><strong>Practice Self-Care</strong>– Make self-care a priority in your life. This can include activities such as exercise, mindfulness, journaling, or spending time in nature. Taking care of your physical and emotional well-being is essential for healing.</li><li><strong>Celebrate Progress</strong>– Celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Healing from parentification is a journey, and it’s important to acknowledge and celebrate the steps you take along the way.</li><p>Remember that healing takes time, and it’s okay to seek support and guidance as you navigate this process. You deserve to live a fulfilling and authentic life, free from the burdens of your past experiences. Keeping a childhood photo or writing a letter to the inner child are some of the exercises that are helpful in healing from parentification.&nbsp;Parentification can have long lasting effects that can be painful.&nbsp;If you experienced parentification try reversing the effects by being a parent you never had and start taking care of yourself. You deserve unconditional love and care. Reaching out to a mental health professional might heal you from parentification and trauma.&nbsp;</p>References +<ul><li>Corelli, C.

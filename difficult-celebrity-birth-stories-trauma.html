"My waters broke and I was in the birthing pool, we had a really easy first three hours, to the point that I thought we would all be home by 7pm. But I don’t remember what happened next.

While the actual birth went to plan, poor Alex was not at all well afterwards, resulting in her being rushed into emergency surgery. The TV star previously spoke to <a class=hm-link href=#>Christine Lampard</a> on Lorraine about the ordeal, which also affected her husband Charlie.</p><p id=evIdSjIEow6b data-wc=59>She said: "I think people really forget how traumatic it can be for dads. Charlie was an immense birthing partner. Of course, when you go into it, you don't know what to expect and he came through it more than I can tell you. Somehow he became this sort of hypnobirthing expert and we just got through it together.</p><p id=eKCKOkUF-1Jx data-wc=38>"Of course, as soon as Teddy was in my arms and my maternal instinct came in, that's all that worried me.

But it was in an open letter to CNN five months later, that the athlete <a class=hm-link href=#>revealed insight</a> into the dramatic birth of her first child.</p><p id=eLioZbVn-BmP data-wc=74>The letter opened: "I almost died after giving birth to my daughter, Olympia. Yet I consider myself fortunate." The sports star, who was runner-up at this summer's Wimbledon Championships, went on to describe how her pregnancy had been smooth-sailing, but the birth was less so. Olympia was born by emergency C-section after her heart-rate had "dropped dramatically" during contractions, but, luckily, the surgery went smoothly and soon the tennis star was holding her newborn.</p><p id=eQ2j38UXQdNv data-wc=88>However, trouble then occurred just 24 hours after she gave birth. Serena stated: "It began with a pulmonary embolism, which is a condition in which one or more arteries in the lungs becomes blocked by a blood clot." Then, the new mum then suffered complications as a result, including re-opening the C-section wound that required surgery, during which doctors found a swelling of clotted blood in her abdomen. Serena then had more surgery before finally being allowed to return home, but spent the next six weeks in bed.</p><p id=eQdNxOJ4WTwK data-wc=40>Although Serena experienced a traumatic and frightening birth, her optimism and determined nature saw her through, stating: "I am so grateful I had access to such an incredible medical team of doctors and nurses at a hospital with state-of-the-art equipment."</p><h2>Gemma Atkinson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e906f3f1619b-gemma-atkinson-baby-mia-z.jpg><p id=eERzz1WlSilW data-wc=42><a class=hm-link href=#>Gemma Atkinson</a> and her <a class=hm-link href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a> pro-dancer boyfriend, <a class=hm-link href=#>Gorka Marquez</a>, welcomed their first child, baby Mia, on 4 July this year. A couple of weeks after giving birth, Gemma shared a picture of her posing with her newborn just 30 hours after she arrived.</p><p id=eFFj4UiK25ct data-wc=93>The birth wasn't all smooth sailing, however, the actress and radio host said on her Instagram: "Mia was a tiny baby, 4lb 10 … With every contraction her heart rate dropped. On the 3rd one midwife Katie who was taking care of me at the time pressed the panic alarm & within 15 mins I was rushed out, prepped & delivered Mia via an emergency Caesarean section…" Although Gemma said the delivery didn't go as planned, she was adamant that thanks to her hypnobirthing breathing techniques she was able to stay calm throughout.</p><p id=eQcr1Bv4bpr3 data-wc=77>After enjoying some alone time as a three, however, Gemma then began feeling unwell and was haemorrhaging. She continued in the post: "I don’t remember much other than having around 9 doctors in the room." Even after enduring such a traumatic labour, Gemma was quick to praise and thank the NHS and the "incredible hospital staff" that aided Mia's entry into the world. She may not have had the easiest labour, but Gemma is definitely a trooper.</p><p id=esPSNn4HHaXm data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Postnatal depression and me: A real-life account of what it's actually like</a></strong></p><h2>Kristina Rihanoff</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aae06242342b-kristina-and-ben-cohen-z.jpg><p id=eXSUetXmPDE9 data-wc=68>Former <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a></strong> professional dancer <a class=hm-link href=#>Kristina Rihanoff</a> gave birth to baby daughter Milena, (Mila for short), in June 2016.

"Every time Kristina pushed, the cord was pulling the baby back," said Ben to <strong>HELLO!</strong> in an <a class=hm-link href=#>exclusive interview</a>. "There comes a point when it is not happening and you do worry."</p><p id=eRYKY44pW3zk data-wc=73>Kristina added: "I can still remember the doctor saying, 'We'll try this and if it doesn't work we will have a Caesarean, I was like, 'No way,' because I'd been struggling for so long.

"We are bursting with love," new mum Vogue revealed to <strong>HELLO!</strong> in September 2018, shortly after the birth. Proud dad Spencer added, "Every day has new meaning now. Now that Theodore is here, it has exceeded all expectation of what I thought it would feel like to be a dad."</p><p id=e3AQA1HZLCL0 data-wc=84>But during the birth there were a few issues that had to be overcome. Two days before Theodore was born, Vogue was admitted to hospital after noticing the baby's movements were slowing. "I was induced at 6am, then Doctor Vasso broke my waters at 12 and the contractions started," Vogue revealed. "They went on until 5pm, when I had an epidural, which was a lifesaver." But it wasn't all clear, Theodore's heartbeat began fluctuating and the decision was then to have an emergency Caesarean.</p><p id=ePg7BHG7xPOb data-wc=96>But luckily, as time went on, it was clear Theodore was on his way and his hate heart rate had gone down, meaning Vogue could go through with a natural birth after all. Spencer added, "I have nothing but love and respect for how Vogue dealt with it all." He added, "The love I have for Vogue kind of doubled because you immediately have that for your son as well. I've never felt love like it other than for Vogue. Just when you think there is no more love in you, along comes Theodore."

Chloe endured a 40-hour labour before Ace was subsequently delivered by emergency Caesarean as the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck.</p><p id=ezOUeGJHPgWL data-wc=84>After he was born, Chloe then developed a serious infection and an adverse reaction to antibiotics. Speaking on the second birth, Chloe stated: "I very much wanted to give birth naturally, but after what happened last time we decided to leave it as late as I could before making any firm decisions." Chiara was then born by a planned Caesarean, which Chloe described as "absolutely the right decision."

The proud dad and business owner said: "Willow is definitely my proudest achievement. She's so happy and already smiling – it's definitely not just wind! – and she's such a chilled baby. We're very lucky." Max's wife Leah, who runs his business from home, said she was very "Zen" during the pregnancy, and says this may have contributed to the baby's calm demeanour.</p><p id=eIiYR_x2Mzoz data-wc=86>Leah used gas and air during labour until she was 9cm dilated, but things then got complicated.

After Georgia's waters broke the day before she was due to be induced, the couple frantically headed to the birthing suite at Chelsea and Westminster hospital, but were then sent home and told to return when contractions were further advanced. Danny then immediately stepped into dad-mode and began timing, and ran the then mum-to-be a bath.</p><p id=etHgA6zbIaRj data-wc=75>Georgia then stated how she went an "overwhelming urge to push" and began panicking that she would end up giving birth in the bath or in the car.

But unfortunately for Zoe, Luna's birth was not quite as straightforward as the previous nine months had been. Zoe ended up needing forceps to deliver her daughter, after a gruelling and prolonged labour without effective pain relief.</p><p id=eX70MNGKBdYnf data-wc=98>While pregnant with Kit, however, the nine months weren't quite as easy for the then mum-to-be as her previous pregnancy. <a class=hm-link href=#>Zoe stated</a>: "My immunity was low so I kept getting colds and mouth ulcers. He was breech until 34 weeks – I had pains in my ribs and back, numbness in my hands. I was desperate to give birth and have done with it." Fortunately, Kit's birth was much more straight-forward than the pregnancy. She said: "It was a much better experience this time … I had an epidural at 8pm and by five past midnight, Kit was born."</p><h2>Louise Thompson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d9772599014a-louise-thompson-leo-hunter-z.jpg><p id=enCRgFYB4oRZa data-wc=35>Last December, <a class=hm-link href=#>Made In Chelsea</a><strong> </strong>star <a class=hm-link href=#>Louise Thomspon</a> welcomed her firstborn, Leo-Hunter with partner Ryan Libbey.

I have been recovering in hospital for a month with various serious complications. In all honesty I never imagined that so many bad things could happen to me, but to dance with death twice brings a whole new view of the world - a stark reminder of how short and sacred life really is."</p><p id=eGy-0nx7uaJ2I data-wc=37>Her followers rushed to the comments section to share their love and support.

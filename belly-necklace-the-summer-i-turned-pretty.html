Han, who also wrote the To All the Boys book series which inspired Netflix’s movies of the same title, is also the creator and an executive producer on The Summer I Turned Pretty series. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Summer I Turned Pretty</a> follows Isabel “Belly” Conklin, the series’ narrator and protagonist, and her love triangle with brothers Conrad and Jeremiah Fisher, the sons of Belly’s mother Laurel Park’s best friend Susannah Fisher.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Collider</a> in 2022, Han explained how she approached her own novels for television. “I approached it like, what do I think are the most important elements of the story to keep? And what do the fans care the most about?” she said. “I am able to pull from all the emails, letters, and comments I’ve seen over the years from fans, so that’s how we looked at this adaptation. What do the original fans care most about? And then, also for me, what’s going to be most like fun and exciting to explore? Because I think as a writer, you have to feel like you’re doing something new in a way, too. That it’s not going to be just the exact same thing, but what’s the new approach? And how do I make this feel fresh?”</p><p>She also told the site about how she took her own book writing process to writing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Summer I Turned Pretty‘s</a> screenplay. “I think that in my novel-writing life, I don’t outline, and it’s very intuitive for me,” she said. “Picture it like I am going through a forest blindfolded, and I’m feeling my way through, and I know where the finish point is, but it’s kind of like, how am I getting there? I also don’t write in order and I kind of see it when it’s like 85 percent, 90 percnt there, then everything comes into focus for me. I often picture like, I’m Iron Man. It was like click, click, click, all the pieces are coming together. That’s how I see the story, and suddenly it becomes clear to me.”</p><p>While the series is best known for the dramatic teen love triangle between Belly, Conrad, and Jeremiah, there’s also a lot to be said about Belly’s necklaces on The Summer I Turned Pretty and the special meanings behind each piece of jewelry.

In an interview with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Teen Vogue</a> in 2023, Lola Tung, who plays Belly, explained how her personal style is different from her character’s. “I do think we are a little bit different,” she said. “She grew up on the beach and that definitely influenced her summer style. She’s always in flip flops, and I lean towards sneakers more. She [Belly] wears a lot of pretty floral outfits and a lot of tank tops and shorts. I feel like I opt for a simpler color palette..neutrals, but I love a fun pop of color.”</p><p>Tung explained that her personal style is more inspired by her childhood growing up in New York City. “I grew up in New York City, so I’ve always been surrounded by creative people who express themselves through fashion,” she said. “My mom always encouraged me to do that and to wear what I love to wear and what makes me feel confident. And she’s passed down a lot of her clothing that she kept to me, which has definitely influenced my style.”</p><p>Tung also described Belly’s style as “beachy” and “laid back” in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cosmopolitan</a> in 2023. “Belly has a very beachy, sort of laid-back but cute and pretty style. She spends a lot of time on the beach, obviously, and I would love to see her in a denim corset with baggy jeans,” she said. “I would love to see her do sort of, like, a fashion moment like that. That would be so cool, just because I think it would be super fun and something different and I love a denim-on-denim moment. I do think she has a really beautiful wardrobe and a lot of very pretty pieces that she wears, especially in this next season. So it’d be cool to see something with a little bit of edge.”</p><p>Christopher Briney, who plays Conrad, described his character’s style to Cosmopolitan as more formal than his brother, Jeremiah’s. “Conrad stays in shorts, a T-shirt, and a flannel. Like, a little button down,” he said. “I think if I was gonna throw something at him, I’d love to throw him like a cargo or just some sort of straight-fit pants. I’d like to see if he enjoys that or not. But that’s for me to him. I know he’s all about a casual button-down.”</p><p>As for Gavin Casalegno, who plays Jeremiah, he described his character’s style in The Summer I Turned Pretty Season 2 as much more “mature” than Season 1. “In season two, Jeremiah is maturing a lot, and he has matured a lot since season one,” he said. “I think what will kind of coincide with the growth of his character are the polos. I think the polos are kind of more, you know, they’re on the beach, I think it just represents their family and their economic situation as well. A nice polo going to a college is kind of where Jeremiah is at.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=will-there-be-a-summer-i-turned-pretty-season-3>Will there be a Summer I Turned Pretty Season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/the-summer-i-turned-pretty-belly-1-.jpg><p>Will there be a Summer I Turned Pretty Season 3? The answer is likely. Jenny Han’s The <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Summer I Turned Pretty book series</a> is a trilogy with three books: 2009’s <a data-pmc-sp-product=f53cc0c4c2ef7b8a5d97ec051cef63f8 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"The Summer I Turned Pretty","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"The Summer I Turned Pretty","price":"15.39","id":"1416968237","category":"Family Life"},"id":1618110,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>The Summer I Turned Pretty</a> ; 2010’s <a data-pmc-sp-product=f1670b6c16ba69ab226854cefdb57b38 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"It’s Not Summer Without You","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"The Summer I Turned Pretty","price":"15.39","id":"1416968237","category":"Family Life"},"id":1618110,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>It’s Not Summer Without You</a> ; and 2011’s <a data-pmc-sp-product=5437c17cb3302f19d733fc23f5a6de66 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"We’ll Always Have Summer","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"The Summer I Turned Pretty","price":"15.39","id":"1416968237","category":"Family Life"},"id":1618110,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>We’ll Always Have Summer</a> . While The Summer I Turned Pretty Season 3 hasn’t been confirmed yet, it’s expected that there will be a third season for the third book.</p><p>Han also confirmed in an interview on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CBS Mornings</a> in 2023 that The Summer I Turned Pretty Season 3 hasn’t been officially confirmed due to the Writer’s Guild Strike. “I hope so. We can’t until the Writer’s Strike. I hope that the studios will come back to the table and negotiate, and we can get back to work,” she said. “I think everyone wants to get back to work, including me.”</p><p>As for what The Summer I Turned Pretty Season 3 could be about, the third season will likely see Belly make her final choice between Jeremiah and Conrad, according to the publisher’s description for It’s Not Summer Without You. “Belly has only ever been in love with two boys, both with the last name Fisher. And after being with Jeremiah for the last two years, she’s almost positive he is her soul mate. Almost,” the publisher’s description reads. “While Conrad has not gotten over the mistake of letting Belly go, Jeremiah has always known that Belly is the girl for him. So when Belly and Jeremiah decide to make things forever, Conrad realizes that it’s now or never—tell Belly he loves her, or lose her for good. Belly will have to confront her feelings for Jeremiah and Conrad and face the inevitable: She will have to break one of their hearts.”</p><p>The Summer I Turned Pretty Season 2 is available to stream on <a href=#>Prime Video</a>.

she&nbsp;is a British journalist and the&nbsp;first ever woman to hold the position of <a href=#>political</a> editor at the <a href=#>BBC</a>, after succeeding <a href=#>Nick Robinson</a>.</p><p>Her dad, Nick Kuenssberg OBE, worked for British thread manufacturers the Coats Group.</p><p>Laura's grandad was the <a href=#>German</a>-born founder and president of the Royal College of General Practitioners (GPs), Dr Ekkehard von Kuenssberg.</p><p>While her grandad on her mum's side, Lord Robertson, was a <a href=#>High Court</a> judge.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Read More on Laura Kuenssberg</h2></p><p>Her mother, Sally Kuenssberg, worked in children's services and received a CBE for this in the 2000 New Year Honours.</p><p>Laura grew up in <a href=#>Glasgow</a> with her brother and diplomat sister Joanna, who was the High Commissioner of the UK to <a href=#>Mozambique</a>&nbsp;from 2014 until 2018.</p><p>She studied for a degree in history at University of <a href=#>Edinburgh</a>, where she would meet her future husband.</p><p>Laura then left for the <a href=#>States</a> and <a href=#>Washington DC</a>, where Laura studied journalism before landing a job with NBC News.</p><p>After returning to Britain, Laura worked for local radio and cable <a href=#>TV</a> channels in Glasgow - as well as doing reporting work for <a href=#>Channel 4</a>.</p><p>She then landed a job with BBC North East and Cumbria in March 2000.</p><p>Laura was later made the chief political correspondent for the Beeb, and led the channel's coverage of the May 2010 <a href=#>General Election</a> and subsequent formation of <a href=#>David Cameron</a>'s <a href=#>Coalition Government</a>.</p><p>In September 2011, Laura left the BBC for the newly created role as business editor with <a href=#>ITV News</a>, and broadcast her first News At Ten segment in August 2013.</p><p>She returned to the BBC to present Newsnight in February 2014 - and was appointed as the political editor in July 2015, making her the first woman to have that role at the organisation.</p><p>She's been a voice of authority during <a href=#>Brexit</a> - and backed up The Sun's bombshell front page which claimed the <a href=#>Queen had voiced Eurosceptic views</a>.</p><p>In December 2021 she confirmed she is <a href=#>stepping down as the BBC's Political Editor</a> for a &nbsp;"senior presenting and reporting role" at the Corporation.</p><p>An announcement followed in March 2022 that Laura would be <a href=#>replacing Andrew Marr</a> as the host of <a href=#>BBC One</a>'s flagship <a href=#>Sunday morning politics show,</a> beginning in September.</p><h2>How much does Laura earn?</h2><p>As of 2023, Laura is listed as earning between £305,000 - £309,999 a year for her job</p><p>She is paid this wage for the Sunday politics show.</p><p>Speaking on her role, Laura said in a statement: “I couldn’t be more delighted.</p><p>"For decades, Sunday morning has been the moment to explore the events that shape us and to challenge and listen to our politicians.</p><p>“It’s an honour to take the chair for that conversation in the 2020s.”</p><h2>Is Laura Kuenssberg married and does she have any children?</h2><p>Laura is married to management consultant James Kelly, who also studied at Edinburgh.</p><p>After his degree, he moved to the US to undertake studies at Harvard University.</p><p>The couple now live together in <a href=#>East London</a> and do not have any children.</p><h2>Has Laura been involved in any controversy?</h2><p>Laura was accused of breaking electoral law by discussing supposed results of postal votes live on air.</p><p>Speaking to the BBC's Politics Live, Laura claimed to have received tip-offs from those with knowledge of early votes cast in the general election, during a discussion about poor weather impacting voter turnout.</p><p>She went on to describe what&nbsp;sources had told her about the results of postal ballots already counted.</p><p>In January 2016, Laura helped arrange for Labour MP Stephen Doughty to publicly announce his resignation as shadow foreign minister on the Daily Politics show.</p><p>The move prompted an official complaint from Seumas Milne, the Labour Party's director of communications, which was rejected by the BBC.</p><p>After the 2016 local elections, a petition on 38 Degrees accused Laura of being biased against Labour leader <a href=#>Jeremy Corbyn</a> - and called for her dismissal.</p><p>It was later withdrawn by 38 Degrees, because of sexist and hateful comments made about the journo.</p><p>In January 2017, the BBC Trust ruled that Laura broke the broadcaster's <a href=#>impartiality and accuracy</a> guidelines in an interview with Corbyn in November 2015.</p><p>It was said that Laura's News at Six segment was edited to wrongly give the impression that Corbyn disagreed with the use of firearms by police in incidents such as the <a href=#>Paris terror attacks</a>.</p><p>In September 2019 Kuenssberg received criticism for her portrayal of <a href=#>Omar Salem</a>, a father who confronted the prime minister, <a href=#>Boris Johnson</a>, about the government's treatment of the <a href=#>NHS</a>.</p><p>On December 11, 2019, the day before the General Election, she drew controversy by claiming on air that submitted postal votes, apparently viewed by both the <a href=#>Labour Party</a> and the <a href=#>Conservative Party</a>, were "looking pretty grim for Labour in a lot of parts of the country".</p><p>By saying this, Laura breached guidelines set by the Electoral Commission - as viewing postal votes prior to polling day and predicting electoral outcomes based on votes cast prior to polls closing may be a criminal offence.</p><p>As a result, footage was withdrawn from all platforms.</p><p>Kuenssberg has also found herself in hot water on <a href=#>Twitter.</a></p><p>She was criticised, alongside other major journalists, for incorrectly tweeting that a Labour activist had punched a Conservative Party advisor, without verification.</p><p>Footage was later released showing this was untrue and she later apologised and retracted her tweet.</p><p>In May 2020, as the<a href=#> Dominic Cummings scandal</a> broke, Kuenssberg tweeted several statements from an anonymous source close to <a href=#>Cummings</a> about the nature of his trip - which led to allegations that Kuenssberg was defending, or repeating his side of the story.</p><p>This led to a significant volume of complaints to the <a href=#>BBC</a>, who defended Kuenssberg's actions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfaH11g5Vxamikkaq%2FonnKrpynq6OXsrOzjJuZnGWgpLmqwMicmKVllZm2tbvRZpyaqp6eu6i%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flaura-kuenssberg-bbc-political-editor-earnings.html&text=Who%20is%20Laura%20Kuenssberg%20and%20how%20much%20does%20she%20earn%3f%20%20The%20Sun&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flaura-kuenssberg-bbc-political-editor-earnings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flaura-kuenssberg-bbc-political-editor-earnings.html&title=Who%20is%20Laura%20Kuenssberg%20and%20how%20much%20does%20she%20earn%3f%20%20The%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flaura-kuenssberg-bbc-political-editor-earnings.html&title=Who%20is%20Laura%20Kuenssberg%20and%20how%20much%20does%20she%20earn%3f%20%20The%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flaura-kuenssberg-bbc-political-editor-earnings.html&title=Who%20is%20Laura%20Kuenssberg%20and%20how%20much%20does%20she%20earn%3f%20%20The%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flaura-kuenssberg-bbc-political-editor-earnings.html&description=Who%20is%20Laura%20Kuenssberg%20and%20how%20much%20does%20she%20earn%3f%20%20The%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./19-astounding-facts-about-noah-hathaway.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="19 Astounding Facts About Noah Hathaway">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./accident-closes-both-directions-on-centennial-bridge.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="UPDATE: Man suffers serious injuries from Centennial Bridge accident">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

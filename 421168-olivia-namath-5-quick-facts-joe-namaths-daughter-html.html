Olivia is the daughter of famous personalities</h3><p class=align-left>Olivia was born in 1991 in the United States of America. Her father, as most people already know, is the legendary <a href=#>American football</a> quarterback Joe Namath. Joe played in Super Bowl III.</p><p class=align-left>Olivia's mother is called Deborah Mays and is also a talented American actress. She has only one sibling, a sister named Jessica Namath. Olivia Namath’s sister is older than her.</p><p class=align-left>Joe Namath's father is also a great actor and has appeared in numerous productions, including <i>C.C. and Company</i>, <i>The Last Rebel</i>, <i>The Wedding Ringer</i>, and many more.</p><p class=align-left>Deborah Mays (Joe Namath's ex-wife), Olivia's mother, is 56 years old as of 2021. She grew up in Remington, Indiana. She is famous for her role in the <a href=#>science</a> fiction comedy-drama series <i>The Greatest American Hero</i> (1981-1983). Also, she staged a Chekhov play in Manhattan in the 1990s.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c8edea257553f549.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Montana Helena Klein Yao: What you should know about Malik Beasley's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Joe Namath confessed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">in an interview</a> that raising her children was the toughest when they were at the ages of 12 and 17.</p>Twelve to 17, oh man, those tough years. Somewhere in there, it just becomes almost like they're not realistic, rational. That's O.K. The main thing is learning to be patient, continuing to listen and not just hear and understanding that reasonable doesn't matter during those years.<h3>2. She had her first child at 16 years old</h3><p class=align-left>Olivia gave <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">birth to her first child</a> in August 2007 in West Palm Beach, when she was 16 years old. She named the child Natalia. At the time, Olivia was still in high school in Florida.</p><h3>3. Olivia was arrested in 2010</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/056aed0e13bc2a47.jpg><p class=align-left>In 2010, Olivia Namath was arrested in West Palm Beach after she was pulled over for speeding. During the incident, police discovered that she had an open bottle of rum and <a href=#>marijuana</a> in her car.

They searched it and found a bag of leafy greens on the driver's side floorboard that later tested positive for the substance. In addition, they later found 200.5 grams of marijuana distributed in baggies in the car's trunk.</p><p class=align-left>However, Olivia Namath denied any knowledge of the marijuana. Also, she was travelling with two men.</p><p class=align-left>After the arrest, Olivia Smith was charged with two counts of marijuana possession. These included one with the intent of selling and another for possession of alcohol by a minor.</p><h3>4. She is married to Edwin Barker III</h3><p class=align-left>Olivia Namath is married to her long-time boyfriend Edwin Baker III. They tied the knot in June 2014 and live happily with their daughter, Natalia Namath, that was born in August 2007, before their marriage.</p><p class=align-left>Edwin Barker, Joe's son-in-law, has had numerous run-ins with the law, primarily associated with his illegal works. He was once arrested for robbing a McDonald's joint and escaping with $10,000 by threatening the manager. On top of this, Edwin Barker was taken to prison for cocaine and marijuana possession.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8ca7e2cee63f8c07.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Nick Wright's wife? 5 quick facts about Danielle Wright</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Even though Edwin Barker III, Olivia Namath’s husband, has had many problems with the law, Joe Namath accepted him as his son in law and attended the <a href=#>wedding</a>. The wedding only had 12 guests.</p><p class=align-left>There is no credible information about how Olivia Namath met Edwin Barker III and why he chose him as his fiancé.

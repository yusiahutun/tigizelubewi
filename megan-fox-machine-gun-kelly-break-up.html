We were oblivious to the pain we would face together in such a short, frenetic period of time. Unaware of the work and sacrifices the relationship would require from us but intoxicated off of the love. And the karma. Somehow a year and a half later, having walked through hell together, and having laughed more than I ever imagined possible, he asked me to marry him. And just as in every lifetime before this one, and as in every lifetime that will follow it, I said yes.…and then we drank each other’s blood. 1.11.22 ✨.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/megan-fox-hair.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/machine-gun-kelly-megan-fox-1.jpg><p>But on February 12, 2023, Fox uploaded a series of <a href=# rel=noopener>photos of herself</a>, plus a video of an envelope burning. She wrote in the caption: “You can taste the dishonesty / it’s all over your breath” which are lyrics from Beyonce’s “Pray You Catch Me” off her 2016 album Lemonade. The post has since been deleted, as is all evidence of her intense relationship with <a href=# id=auto-tag_machine-gun-kelly data-tag=machine-gun-kelly>Machine Gun Kelly</a>, whose real name is Colson Baker. Here’s what we know.</p><h2>Did Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly break up?</h2><p>Did <a href=# id=auto-tag_megan-fox data-tag=megan-fox>Megan Fox</a> and Machine Gun Kelly break up? It doesn’t appear that way but sources say the relationship is rocky but they’re trying to work things out. On February 19, 2023, Fox reactivated her Instagram to address the rumors of infidelity. “There has been no third party interference in this relationship of any kind. That includes, but is not limited to…actual humans, DMs, AI bots or succubus demons,” she wrote. “While I do hate to rob you of running random baseless news stories that would have been much more accurately written by ChatGPT, you need to let this story die and leave all of these innocent people alone now.”</p><p>The last photo in Fox’s last Instagram post before she deleted her account included her appearing to <a href=# rel=noopener>burn some letters</a>. A fan commented on the post by speculating that Baker might have cheated on Fox with his guitarist Sophie Lloyd, “He probably got with Sophie.” She responded jokingly: “Maybe I got with Sophie.”</p><p>When she reactivated her Instagram, she posted in support of MGK’s guitarist. “How me making a joke in order to absolve this girl of a hurtful accusation somehow turned into a confirmation of it—I will never understand,” she wrote. “Why are people so….so dumb.” She continued, “Sophie you are insanely talented. Welcome to Hollywood. Your first unwarranted PR disaster. You have now been baptized by the flames of fame. It only gets worse from here unfortunately. Just ignore it as much as you can.&nbsp;❤️middle finger up.” Sophie replied, “The internet is so wild! Sending so much love.”</p><p>On February 13, a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> that “Megan is very upset. They had a fight over the weekend and Megan won’t speak to him,” the insider said. They “haven’t officially called off the engagement but Megan took her ring off… They have had issues in the past, but things seem pretty serious this time.”</p><p>In photos obtained by the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Daily Mail</a>, Fox and MGK were spotted looking “emotional” as they left a couples’ counselor in Los Angeles on February 14 (see the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">photos here</a>). “Megan appeared emotional as she wiped her eyes with her hand while leaving the building while a pensive MGK followed closely behind,” the tabloid observed. “The pair were seen talking to one another as they walked into the car park, before leaving in separate cars. They are believed to have spent two and a half hours inside the building.” A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> on the same day that “they are speaking and trying to work things out.” However, Fox “is still upset” and “taking one day at a time” when it comes to the future with her actor-musician beau. “She was never one to casually date,” the source continued. “She is with him because she believes it’s a long-term relationship. She isn’t just gonna give up on their relationship. “There are trust issues and this causes conflicts right now. Megan is taking one day at a time.” Another source said, “Megan is still upset but is not giving up on their relationship. He feels the same way. They are getting professional help because they want things to work out.”</p><p>Another source backed up their relationship to<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow"> Us Weekly,</a> “They have a very intense relationship, and they are both very passionate people. That combination can sometimes explode, and they love hard but also fight hard,” the insider told the gossip site, noting the duo&nbsp;frequently go through “this type of drama” together. “It is really a communication issue that they need to work through and that is why they are going to counseling.”</p><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> that on the day her Instagram disappeared, the pair had been out at parties together “every night” and “seemed fine” but his mood appeared to change. “Megan and MGK have been together all of Super Bowl weekend. They’ve been out at parties together every night, including last night and seemed fine. Last night MGK also performed at a party, but he seemed a bit off. His energy was low, and the performance wasn’t great.” During an appearance at Sports Illustrated’s The Party on the eve of Super Bowl 2023, Page Six reported he said: “This one’s for the ladies,” before performing one of his most famous hits, “Bloody Valentine.” Another source told the site that an argument affected his mood during the performance.”MGK wasn’t in the right frame of mind to be performing after this,” the source says. “He wasn’t himself and his band carried the show on their backs. It wasn’t a usual MGK performance or what people expect from him. His mic died while performing ‘Bloody Valentine’ and he tapped it and seemed annoyed before someone came to replace it.”</p><p>The source also told Entertainment Tonight that Megan likes to troll her followers whenever their relationship is at a low. “Megan and MGK have a very intense relationship with lots of highs and lows. They have a tendency to get into arguments and then end up making up,” the source said, adding that Megan “also likes to troll her fans during the more ‘off’ times between them for attention.” The other said that “Megan and MGK have a passionate relationship filled with lots of intense emotions, both good and bad, but after this fight, Megan was very upset,” the source says. “She was initially supposed to come [to the Sports Illustrated party] with MGK to the event and had a whole outfit planned, but she backed out last minute.” Another source told the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">site</a> on February 15, 2023, “Megan and MGK have had ups and downs throughout their relationship, but at the end of the day, they have a lot of love for each other and a deep connection,” the source told ET. “They have very strong feelings for one another, so their emotions often come out in intense ways.” The source added, “They are working together with the goal of trying to mend things and move forward together.”</p><p>Before her Instagram was deactivated, eagle-eyed fans also noticed she was following only three people: Harry Styles, Timothée Chalamet and Eminem—MGK’s rival. His feud with the rapper began in 2012 when Baker tweeted about Eminem’s then-16-year-old daughter, Hailie Jade Mathers: “I have to say, she is hot as f—k, in the most respectful way possible cuz Em is king.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/machine-gun-kelly-megan-fox-.jpg><p>In an April 2022&nbsp;interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Glamour U.K.</a>, Fox gushed over her bleach-blonde beau, saying that she believes she’s responsible for “manifesting” his existence: “He’s literally my exact physical type that I’ve been&nbsp;manifesting since I was four,” the&nbsp;Jennifer’s Body&nbsp;actress said. “I’m also four years older than him. So, I think I made him.”</p><p>Upon their engagement, Fox revealed the unique design for her ring which at first looked like a standard toi e moi design but upon closer inspection, the couple put their own twist on it: “The concept is that the ring can come apart to make two rings,” Baker told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Vogue</a> in January 2022. When it’s together, it’s held in place by a magnet. So you see how it snaps together? And then it forms an obscure heart. And you see this right here? The bands are actually thorns. So if she tries to take it off, it hurts.”</p><p>Fox and Baker received some criticism for this; some people thought it was normalizing abusive and/or controlling relationships. But Fox defended their relationship, telling Glamour UK: “[It seems] I have to meet a certain requirement or follow all of these rules,” she says. “It’s very bizarre to get judged for, like, ‘What if I am in a BDSM relationship? And I’m like, yes – is that OK with you? Because that’s what I want.’ So, I shouldn’t be outcast from the feminist community, because that is something that I prefer for myself. I feel sexual power in that way, by experiencing it that way.”</p><p>She continued: “I was being celebrated as being a feminist until I had the nerve to call my boyfriend, ‘Daddy,’’’ she says sarcastically. “And a lot of people got upset about that, which I think is a funny conversation to actually have, because that goes into allowing women to be… women. Allowing us to experience what we want in life, what we like. That is feminism.”</p><p>The Transformers actress and the “Bad Things” rapper confirmed their relationship on Monday, June 15 2020, when the Daily Mail published photos of them holding hands and kissing for the first time since news broke that Megan’s relationship with the&nbsp;Beverly Hills, 90210 alum Brian Austin Green had ended after 10 years of marriage.</p><p>A source told Us Weekly on Tuesday, May 19 2020, that the two—who met on the set of the upcoming film,&nbsp;Midnight in the Switchgrass—started as friends but their relationship soon became romantic after Megan split from Green at the end of 2019. “[They] began spending more and more time together because of their work schedules and filming together,” the insider said. “They started off as friends and their relationship grew from there. Megan thinks MGK is a really cool guy and their relationship turned more romantic.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShoppingNewsletter_onsitegraphic.png alt="StyleCaster Shopping Newsletter Sign Up" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=p1><span class=s1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

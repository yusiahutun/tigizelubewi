It's still a fantastic console that has a lot to offer. Let's look at seven reasons you should keep hold of your PS4.</p><h2 id=your-ps4-has-games-you-can-39-t-find-elsewhere>1. Your PS4 Has Games You Can't Find Elsewhere</h2><p>A key reason to keep your PS4 is that you might have certain games downloaded on it that you can't play anywhere else.</p><p>This isn't the same as a PS4 exclusive—instead, these are games that Sony has pulled from the PS Store (think P.T, the spiritual successor to Silent Hill) or that the PS5 isn't backward compatible with (though, there are only seven <a href=#>PS4 games the PS5 can't play</a> at last count).</p><p>Though you might not play them now, if there's a particular game you'd love to revisit that you can only play on your PS4, then consider keeping it.</p><h2 id=your-ps4-brings-nostalgia-and-charm>2. Your PS4 Brings Nostalgia and Charm</h2><p>Your PS4's been your gaming companion throughout the previous console generation. Depending on when you got a PS4, this could be up to several years. And if you got a PS4 at launch, that's over seven years' worth of gaming memories. Do you really want to let that go?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though their tech is outdated, older games consoles charm us in ways that modern ones can't, inducing nostalgia. You might not gel with the PS5, or you could lose interest in truly modern gaming. Regardless, your PS4 will always be there, waiting for you to recapture some treasured moments.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Reasons Why You Should Buy Old Games Consoles</a></span></p><h2 id=you-don-39-t-have-or-want-a-ps5>3. You Don't Have or Want a PS5</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ps5-top-sony-logo.jpg><p>If you're not keen on getting a PS5 or can't get one anytime soon, then you should definitely keep your PS4.</p><p>In this case, your PS4 is the perfect gaming companion, capable of playing modern games plus showcasing its impressive catalog. Sure, the PS4 might not run current games as well as the PS5, but it performs better than you think. Even if you'd rather wait to play certain games on a PS5, there are other PS4 games to play in the meantime.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whether you're waiting for the PS5 to become readily available, or you're simply not interested in Sony's ninth-gen console, your PS4 can deliver a satisfying gaming experience that could easily last you the next few weeks, months, or years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Things to Do While You're Waiting to Buy a PS5</a></span></p><h2 id=you-can-play-your-ps5-via-your-ps4-using-remote-play>4. You Can Play Your PS5 via Your PS4 Using Remote Play</h2><p>Did you know that your PS4 can provide a secondary console for you to play PS5 games? Well, it can, using the PS4 and PS5's Remote Play feature.</p><p>Here, you can still enjoy PS5 games even if people are using the TV your PS5 connects to, which is handy if other people in your household have guests over, for example. This adds a fresh, useful angle to your PS4, despite it being several years into its lifespan.</p><p>Remote Play is a neat feature, and it's great that you can use it to play PS5 games on your PS4 and vice versa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=your-ps4-could-be-a-communal-or-backup-console>5. Your PS4 Could Be a Communal or Backup Console</h2><p>If you upgrade from your PS4, that doesn't mean it's entirely useless. For instance, you might feel safer if you're living in shared housing and your PS4's in the living room instead of your shiny new PS5.</p><p>In this way, your PS4 can serve as a communal console for anyone to play and enjoy while you keep your PS5 safe in your room. The PS4 actually excels here, as it can double down as a shared media player, meaning you and your household can enjoy group films, Netflix binges, and play Spotify playlists from it.</p><p>Your PS4 could also be a backup console. For example, if you're staying somewhere for a while but would rather keep your PS5 in your primary home, or if you need to send your PS5 away for a repair.</p><h2 id=enjoy-cheap-ps4-games>6. Enjoy Cheap PS4 Games</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ps-store-deals-web-page.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chances are there are hundreds, if not thousands, of PS4 games you haven't played. And now is a better time than ever to get stuck in.</p><p>If you've been on the PlayStation Store throughout 2020 and 2021, you'll appreciate the regular sales that frequent Sony's digital storefront. From triple-A blockbusters to hidden gems, you'll find tons of discounts on PS4 games, whether digital on the PS Store or physical at video games stores.</p><p>And, with the price of modern games steadily increasing, you'll get an excellent bang for your buck, in comparison, if you buy these discounted PS4 games.</p><p>You're best to start with <a href=#>some wonderful PS4 exclusives</a> that you've not experienced yet, but there's a whole load of great PS4 games out there. Be sure to try them while they're so cheap.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-want-both-microsoft-and-sony-consoles>7.

If you end up enjoying what Microsoft has to offer, then you've got the best of both worlds with Sony and Microsoft's games consoles.</p><p>With your PS4, you can enjoy Sony's outstanding exclusives and frequent digital discounts. With Xbox, there's access to Xbox Game Pass and legendary franchises like Halo. You also don't tie yourself down to a single ecosystem, which is useful, especially if you're taking a chance on a completely new one with Xbox.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you keep your PS4 while you venture into the world of Xbox, you can enjoy all the perks that both PlayStation and Xbox have to offer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Ways Xbox Is Beating PlayStation in the Console Wars</a></span></p><h2 id=when-you-keep-your-ps4-you-keep-one-of-sony-39-s-top-consoles>When You Keep Your PS4, You Keep One of Sony's Top Consoles</h2><p>The PS4 is still an incredible console that packs a punch even near the end of its lifecycle. Though the PS5 is here, there are plenty of good reasons you should keep hold of your PS4.</p><p>Sony put out a great console back in 2013, arguably the winner of its generation.

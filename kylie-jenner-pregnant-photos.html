The A-listers were first linked in April 2023 when DeuxMoi posted an anonymous tip that claimed “multiple sources have told me that Timmy C has a new girl…Kylie Jenner. ⚰️.”</p><p>On April 2, 2024, podcaster Daniel Tosh made totally unfounded claims that the&nbsp;Kardashians&nbsp;star was expecting a baby with&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>her boyfriend of 12 months</a>. “Here’s something crazy. I went to the grocery store in Malibu, and I was talking to an employee there. I try to avoid it but I was talking to this guy, and I said, ‘Why were you guys closed yesterday?’ He goes, ‘Well, I’m not supposed to discuss it, but&nbsp;Keeping Up With the Kardashians,&nbsp;the show, was filming their season finale here yesterday,’” Tosh claimed.</p><p>“Spoiler alert, this is for the upcoming season of the show. This is the big season finale. This random grocery store person is telling me that they rented out the entire store, shut it down and then, they acted like they were grocery shopping,” He added: “This was the scene that apparently happened: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Kylie reveals that she’s pregnant again</a> with Timothée’s kid. What a bombshell.” Tosh added, “This might not be true. I am not verifying anything. This is what an employee at a grocery store in Malibu told me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=kylie-jenner-s-pregnancy-photos>Kylie Jenner’s pregnancy photos</h2><p>Now, fans are growing convinced that the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is expecting once more. Here are Kylie Jenner’s pregnancy photos and how she managed to keep her first child completely under wraps.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.7212055974166><h2>July 2017: 2 months (ish) pregnant with Stormi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kylie-jenner-pregnant.jpg><p>This photo of Kylie Jenner was taken in July 2017. The most <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">likely conception date for a baby due</a> on February 1, 2018, was&nbsp;May 10, 2017, based on a “typical” 40-week pregnancy, so at this point, Kylie would be two months into her pregnancy and unlikely to be showing much at this point.</p><p>As to why she kept her pregnancy hidden until after Stormi’s birth, she wrote on Instagram: “There was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal I had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion, so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness. Pregnancy has been the most beautiful, empowering and life-changing experience I’ve had in my entire life, and I’m actually going to miss it. I appreciate my friends and especially my family for helping me make this special moment as private as we could.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>July 2017: 2 months (ish) pregnant at Wireless Festival</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-810902348.jpg><p>Again, this picture taken at Wireless Festival as she watches Travis Scott perform would’ve been one month (approximately) or less into her pregnancy with Stormi, so it’s unlikely she’d be showing any bump. The pregnancy “pop” usually happens around 16 weeks to 20 weeks.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.5><h2>May 2021: The month Aire was likely conceived</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kylie-jenner-june.jpg><p>Kylie may not have even known she was pregnant at the time this photo was taken on May 22, 2021, so there’s nothing to hide at this point.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>June 2021: 2 months-ish pregnant with Aire</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kylie-jenner-2.jpg><p>Once again, the likely conception date for her son, Aire (formerly Wolf) was around May 10 2021 so Kylie would be around two months pregnant at the time this photo was taken on June 15, 2021.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.884><h2>September 2021: Big accessories</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kylie-jenner-pregnant4.jpg><p>While out for lunch on New York’s Upper East Side, Kylie used two very loud accessories to draw attention away from her pregnant belly. The cow print boots and the oversized faux fur hat ensure that eyes are basically looking everywhere but her midsection. This photo was taken on September 10, 2021, three days after she announced <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>she was pregnant on Instagram</a>, however, so it’s not like she was deliberately hiding anything.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>September 2021: All white</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kylie-jenner-4.jpg><p>Wearing white might seem counter-intuitive for someone trying to hide a pregnancy belly but for someone who gets photographed everywhere she goes, it actually makes total sense. The flashes from the paparazzi actually flatten out curves and creases because the light bounces off the fabric. Again, this photo was taken after Kylie made her announcement on Instagram.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>September 2021: Revolve NYFW</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kylie-jenner6.jpg><p>Bright colors are a surefire way to hide a pregnancy belly, as are oversized fits. Jenner ticks both boxes in this orange look for Revolve’s NYFW presentation. This photo was taken on September 9, 2021, after she announced her pregnancy.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1><h2>March 2024: Vanity Fair Oscars Party</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kylie-jenner.jpg><p>Taken on March 10, 2024, three weeks before the pregnancy rumors began.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=12.318339100346><h2>Late March 2024: Black latex</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kylie-jenner-1.jpg><p>This photo was taken on March 21, 2024—Daniel Tosh claimed that Kylie Jenner was pregnant on April 2. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">response to the rumor</a>, sources close to the&nbsp;Keeping Up With The Kardashians production team told Us Weekly they didn’t film their season finale—or any scenes—this season in the grocery store.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s pretty clear from this photo that Jenner is not pregnant despite what fans so desperately want to believe because there’s no way in hell a woman trying to hide a pregnancy would wear a skin-tight black latex dress.</p><p>It’s not enough to convince fans though. On Reddit, one user observed that the reality TV star had been quieter than usual on social media, as well as sharing a lot of sponsored content rather than candids: “The sweats, going dark on Instagram once again, reposting old ads on Insta… Oh I’m onto her…” they noted. Another wrote: “Kylie not beating the pregnancy allegations…”</p><p>It’s not to say she hasn’t been posting on the grid, but fans are discerning. Instagram photos can, of course, be taken and published at any time. “This is also why I’m entertaining the Kylie pregnancy rumours as possible fact… It’s super easy to take a bunch of pics in different outfits, with different hairstyles, in slightly different locations and save them to post for&nbsp;next&nbsp;year,” one wrote.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.8111380145278><h2>April 26, 2024: Kylie responds to pregnancy rumors</h2><p>On April 26, 2024, Kylie Jenner took to Instagram stories (which have since expired) to show off her new denim collection in her Khy by Kylie Jenner fashion line. Wouldn’t you know it, she was wearing a cropped top to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>display a flat, definitely-not-pregnant</a> stomach. She didn’t address the rumors vocally, but you get the idea this was her subtly responding.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfoMattcRmoZ6mnpq%2FbrzRnp6nmZ6perG0zq2mrGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkylie-jenner-pregnant-photos.html&text=Is%20She%20Expecting%20Timothee%20Chalamets%20Baby%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkylie-jenner-pregnant-photos.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkylie-jenner-pregnant-photos.html&title=Is%20She%20Expecting%20Timothee%20Chalamets%20Baby%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkylie-jenner-pregnant-photos.html&title=Is%20She%20Expecting%20Timothee%20Chalamets%20Baby%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkylie-jenner-pregnant-photos.html&title=Is%20She%20Expecting%20Timothee%20Chalamets%20Baby%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkylie-jenner-pregnant-photos.html&description=Is%20She%20Expecting%20Timothee%20Chalamets%20Baby%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joe-jonas-and-dulce-maria.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joe Jonas and Dulce Mara">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./doja-cat-coachella-outfits.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Doja Cats 6 Coachella Outfits Included a Leotard Covered in Hair">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

You can have a glance at our user guide below to understand how to choose the most worthwhile pick.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Select the Best Face Oil for Gua Sha?</h2></p><p>Finding the best match for the gua sha face oil<strong> </strong>may be tedious since we have abundant options on the market. But here we have done the work to assist you throughout your shopping journey.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Ingredients&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The first step to begin your search quest is to check for the ingredient list. After all, ingredients are an integral part of any skincare product. Try options infused with botanical extracts and organic ingredients to ensure their efficacy. Avoid formulas with chemical ingredients such as parabens, gluten, sulfates, etc., as they alter the natural pH, causing irritation and discomfort.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Skin Type&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The best oils to use for gua sha are suitable for most skin types, but a few formulations benefit more than othersâ€” thanks to the added specific ingredients. Those with dry skin type may try hydrating and moisturizing oils with additives like squalene, hyaluronic acid, coconut oil, etc. These protect the moisture barrier and prevent water loss to keep skin soft and plump. Further, non-comedogenic options formulated with tea tree oil, aloe, and jojoba align well with acne-prone and oily skin. These reduce pore clogging and balance sebum production to tackle breakouts and inflammation. Plant oils like tea tree oil contain antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties to alleviate acne bumps, according to a <a href=#><u>study published on NCBI</u></a>. Anti-aging oils with ingredients like retinol help increase collagen and elastin synthesis to avert aging signs. Hence, they suit mature skin. For sensitive skin types, mild and hypoallergenic blends do wonders.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Cold Pressed v/s Heat Pressed Oils&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>When it comes to oils, you may encounter these two buzzing words on the product labels. So here we have done the complete breakdown to help you understand the difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Cold-pressed oils are extracted at low temperatures through mechanical methods like pressing. This preserves the natural nutritional value and potency. Contrastingly, hot-pressed oils are manufactured at higher temperatures. Plus, they are treated with chemicals to maintain the acidity levels. Hence, most essential nutrients are destroyed with less or no nutritional value. Therefore, cold-pressed oils are the clear winner you can go with.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Consistency&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The oil's consistency is a matter of personal choice. Some like a thicker consistency, while others prefer a thin texture. However, it's better to ensure the oil doesn't sit on the surface and absorbs well without leaving residue or feeling heavy.&nbsp;</p><p>We hope you have now understood how you can filter the options and find the most suitable pick. Now it's time to learn how to use the best gua sha oil correctly.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=title>How to Apply the Best Face Oil for Gua Sha?</h2></p><p>Here are the steps you can follow to use the gua sha face oil correctly.&nbsp;</p><li>Start with a thorough and gentle cleanse. Before gliding your gua sha stone, it's crucial to remove dead skin cells and other impurities for better oil absorption.&nbsp;</li><li>Prime your skin with a lightweight facial essence formula to add moisture and smoothen the surface.&nbsp;</li><li>Apply 2-3 drops of your favorite gua sha oil and glide the tool gently in circular motions or straight strokes.&nbsp;</li><li>Put the amount of pressure you are comfortable with.&nbsp;</li><li>Complete your routine by applying a mild moisturizer to lock in moisture.&nbsp;</li><h3><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Gua sha is one of the most beloved skincare techniques that offers subtle glowing skin. Pairing this routine with the best face oils for gua sha amplifies the effects and ensures a smooth and hassle-free experience. The products listed above are the latest additions to the Gua Sha product lineup that target your specific skin health goals. Be it dullness, dryness, aging signs, or any other skin issue, the formulations help with all. Though the market has tons of options available, you can consider a few factors, like ingredients, skin type, and consistency, to add the right pick to your cart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=title>FAQ's</h2><p>Is it important to use a face oil for gua sha?</p><p>Applying face oil helps glide the stone carefully and accurately. This ensures that the gua sha tool goes smoothly without tugging. Plus, the oil absorbs deep into the skin to nourish and hydrate it for a healthy glow.</p><p>What should I avoid after gua sha treatment?</p><p>After a gua sha treatment, you must avoid exposure to cold. Avoid sitting near air conditioners or fans as these may constrict the vessels, leading to low blood circulation over the area. Plus, you should refrain from applying too much pressure to prevent redness.</p><p>How long should I go for gua sha?</p><p>Typically, dermatologists recommend going for the process three to four times a week with a session of three to five minutes each.</p><h2 class=title>Why Trust Pinkvilla</h2><p>Anoushka, our skincare coach, is a beauty buzz queen who always stays updated with the latest skincare trends.

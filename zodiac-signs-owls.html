Every creature in the animal kingdom carries their own strengths, but none come close to the ancient wisdom of the owl.</p><p>When you hear the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sound of an owl singing</a>, hooting, or even screeching after dark, you can’t help but feel the hair standing up on the back of your neck. They make their presence known when all <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the world is asleep</a>, slicing through the silence of night with a lingering melody that lets you know you are definitely not alone. Cultures from all over the world have considered owls to represent hidden knowledge, intuition, and transformation, as they reign when consciousness is at a minimum and deep-seated truths rise to the surface.</p><p>When you are visited by an owl, you can trust that you are on the brink of major change. If you’re someone who feels especially drawn to owls, you’re someone who’s willing to stare unflinchingly at the truth—even if it may be too difficult to fathom. And if you happen to dream about an owl, you should think of it as a powerful warning from your subconscious mind. Take it seriously, as this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>spooky and mysterious</a> bird is trying to tell you something.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astrologynewslettersignup.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-owl-that-captures-each-zodiac-sign>The Owl That Captures Each Zodiac Sign</h2><p>Because everyone was born with their own spirituality, intuition, and hidden wisdom, here’s the species of owl that captures each zodiac sign:</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Aries: You're the Great Horned Owl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1432110247.jpg><p>Every owl is a ferocious predator, but none come close to the most alpha owl of all time—the great horned owl. And in astrology, Aries is the zodiac sign of dominance and aggressiveness. Being that an Aries is ruled by Mars—planet of combat—they radiate the heat of an apex predator 24-hours a day, seven days a week. As the formidable great horned owl silently scans their prey from trees high up above, they’re known to swoop down on their marks in the dead of night with alarming accuracy. With no known predators of their own, this species is famous for fighting each other when their territories are encroached.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Taurus: You're the Snowy Owl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1480488961.jpg><p>Taurus evokes a warm, luxurious, and nostalgic vibe that perfectly captures the stubborn serenity of a snowy owl. Ruled by beautiful and pleasure-oriented Venus, Taurus would much rather chill out and stay grounded, much like the snowy owl flies low across tundra and doesn’t have to search hard for prey that already stands out against the white expanse of snow. They’re also known for their fashionable furry slippers that adorn their talons and the way they can swallow their prey whole in one fell swoop. Don’t worry—they cough up a pellet of bone and tendon later. And of course, their enduring status as Harry Potter’s Hedwig makes them a beloved favorite.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Gemini: You're the Screech Owl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1404698302.jpg><p>Everyone knows Geminis love to talk, using their voice and mannerisms to communicate their thoughts, ideas, and desires. And of all the owl species known to man, none use their vocal cords quite as beautifully and cunningly as the North American screech owl. Geminis—aka the “twins” of the zodiac—always have two sides to their personality, which is why there exists an eastern screech owl and a western screech owl that share plenty of artistic differences. While the eastern screech owl’s song sounds like a descending whistle, the western screech owl sounds more like an extended “hoot” that floats up and down.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.5><h2>Cancer: You’re the Little Owl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-126375437.jpg><p>Cancers are known for being homebodies, often preferring the cozy feeling of being safe and sound over exploring out and about. The little owl agrees, as this cavity-dwelling species is known for nesting in tight crevices, such as tree holes, rock crags, and hay stacks. This species also has loyalty to their nesting sights, returning year after year as though they remember exactly where they’d prefer to raise their families. Like the seemingly sweet Cancer, you should never underestimate a little owl. Despite their more petite size, they’ll capture prey that’s even heavier than themselves. What Cancer isn’t willing to carry a burden?</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5><h2>Leo: You’re the Burrowing Owl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1296907140-1.jpg><p>Owls are famous for being nocturnal predators, always skulking for prey with their night vision. However, Leos come alive when the sun rises, as they are ruled by the light of day. Burrowing owls are one of the few species that are most active when the sun is shining, matching their expressive temperament. Burrowing owls are much the same, as their silly expressions, odd stretches, and comical antics make them fascinating (and hilarious) to watch. Leo is the zodiac sign of drama and theatrics, which is why they’re always willing to put on a show. Also, Leo loves being adored and taken care of, which matches the way these owls gift each other food during their mating rituals.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Virgo: You're the Spectacled Owl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-174679562.jpg><p>Virgo is often considered one of the smartest and most well-informed zodiac signs. They’re the first to read the manual, study the fine print, and pay attention to what’s going on. The spectacled owl can relate, as their facial structure mimics the appearance of wearing glasses, making them look quite bookish. This tropical owl is just as smart as it looks, because they’re one of the most observational species of them all. They have incredibly keen eyesight that would put night vision goggles to shame and their facial disk directs tiny, almost imperceptible sounds straight to their eardrums. Nothing gets past the spectacled owl.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Libra: You're the Barred Owl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-999206052.jpg><p>Ruled by Venus—planet of love and artistic connection—Libras are always spreading beauty wherever they go. They’re also cunning air signs with a great sense of humor, much like the barred owl rolls his head back in maniacal laughter. Aside from their soft plumage that you can’t help but want to touch, this species of owl is known for their melodic songs that linger in your imagination. They’re also one of the few that prefer a life of monogamy, choosing to mate with another owl of their species for life. Libra is literally the zodiac sign of balance and harmony, especially in a relationship. The barred owl’s mating dance is enough to make a Libra blush.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5><h2>Scorpio: You're the Barn Owl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-613278764.jpg><p>Scorpio is associated with death, rebirth, and transformation. And like this spooky zodiac sign, the barn owl has a reputation for being one of the creepiest and most fear-inducing owls (and for good reason). Their black eyes, pale features, and ghostly faces make them mysterious as it is, but their terrifying screech has earned them a dark reputation across the world. From the ancient Celts to the Aztecs, the sound of this species crying in the night has come to be known as a warning for death and destruction. Fortunately, like Scorpios, the barn owl’s bark hurts far less than their bite. They’re about the same size as a cat and weigh only a pound, so don’t be scared!</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Sagittarius: You're the Short-eared Owl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1560723312.jpg><p>In astrology, Sagittarius is the quintessential explorer of the zodiac. Always in the mood to travel, Sagittarius is the first sign to chase the experience of something new. Short-eared owls are one of the few species that migrate long distances, as the ones living in the north tend to migrate south during the winter months. They’re capable of traveling as far as 1,200 miles and they’re even willing to fly long distances over large bodies of water. In fact, this species is famous for landing on ships way out at sea. Only a Sagittarius would have the innate desire to fly that far away from home.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2>Capricorn: You're the Eurasian Eagle Owl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-599530728.jpg><p>Everyone knows that when a Capricorn puts down their feet, they mean business. This sign is one of the most dominating forces in the zodiac, radiating power, legacy, and leadership. The Eurasian eagle owl is one of the most undefeated avian predators in existence and their wingspan is impressive—a resounding six and a half feet. Capricorn is also highly loyal, reflecting the way this species is known for monogamous behavior and mating for life. However, they’re also known for preying on their owlets to eliminate competition, much like Saturn had a tendency to eat his own children in Greek mythology. Let’s not forget Saturn is Capricorn’s ruling planet.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Aquarius: You're the Bay Owl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-510248219.jpg><p>If you’re looking for an Aquarius, you would look for the person who goes against the grain; the one who always strives to be different from everyone else. These eccentric folk may even feel like they should have been born on a different planet, and if we’re being honest, the bay owl of southeast Asia looks more like an alien species than an owl. With their eerie vertical eyes that pierce right through the shadow of night, these tiny owls have no problem standing out from the crowd. Like all air signs, Aquarius also loves to talk, and they relate to the wide variety of songs these creatures have in their repertoire.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Pisces: You're the Long-eared Owl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1422639421.jpg><p>One of the most difficult owls to find will always be the long-eared owl, as they’re famous for their secretive and highly nocturnal behavior. Pisces can relate to the way the long-eared owl is lingering on the fringe between this world and the next, as Pisces is the zodiac sign that lives most closely to the spirit world and can disappear on cue. Even though you might have trouble finding a Pisces when they’re feeling withdrawn, you’ll always be able to sense their unique presence. The long-eared owl makes themselves known in an equally mysterious way. Although they’re often hidden in shadows, you can hear the deep sound of a male owl’s hoot from up to a kilometer away.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfr7yltcCcZKyhl6PAbrvWpapo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fzodiac-signs-owls.html&text=Zodiac%20Signs%20as%20OwlsWhich%20One%20Captures%20Your%20Spirit%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fzodiac-signs-owls.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fzodiac-signs-owls.html&title=Zodiac%20Signs%20as%20OwlsWhich%20One%20Captures%20Your%20Spirit%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fzodiac-signs-owls.html&title=Zodiac%20Signs%20as%20OwlsWhich%20One%20Captures%20Your%20Spirit%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fzodiac-signs-owls.html&title=Zodiac%20Signs%20as%20OwlsWhich%20One%20Captures%20Your%20Spirit%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fzodiac-signs-owls.html&description=Zodiac%20Signs%20as%20OwlsWhich%20One%20Captures%20Your%20Spirit%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./big-brother-contestants-kicked-off-show.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5 Big Brother Contestants Who Got Kicked Off The Show">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ty-sutton-named-ceo-of-victory-theatre-association-in-dayton-ohio.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ty Sutton Named CEO Of Victoria Theatre Association In Dayton, Ohio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

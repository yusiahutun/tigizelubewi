Despite being a new member of the show, she emerged as one of the most liked people and won the hearts of the audience.</span></p><h3><b>Early Life</b></h3><p><span>Candice Mishler was born in 1987 in Arizona, grew up as a tomb boy, and considered herself a daddy’s girl. She accompanied her dad in almost every task, including working on trucks, camping, weekend shooting, etc. She was not the girl who would rather play with barbies and dolls.</span></p><p><span>Instead, she took mechanics classes as suggested by her father and also because she could work on their car, and her father wanted her to be independent and strong. This made her fall in love with outdoor activities and countless other activities like fishing, camping, hunting, etc. Today, Candice lives almost 10 minutes away from her dad, and they share a strong bond.</span></p><h3><b>Candice Mishler Career</b></h3><p><span>Candice Mishler has earlier appeared in shows like 90-Day Fiancé: the Single Life Season 3 and Naked and Afraid Season 15. She got the opportunity at Naked and Afraid Season 15 through Instagram, and the cast asked her if she wanted to participate as a TV personality. Though she would watch the show with her dad, she first considered it a scam. She went through the selection process and was later selected as one of the cast members. After waking up and going to sleep with daily challenges, she got skilled with her talent.</span></p><p><span>Candice had never been away from her family. While doing daily challenges, she had to prepare for that mentally but went into the rabbit hole. She started feeling weak daily, and going home and redeeming herself was hard. </span><span>Candice Mishler participates in TV shows and also owes a company with her family. The company is called Doege Development, and they have tasks like doing commercial development in places including Arizona, Texas, and Nevada. She says she is like a male figure for her family and work.</span></p><p><span>This further motivates her to do hard work. </span><span>Fishing and hunting are the two tasks that she has continuously been doing since childhood. And because of the same interest, she is a member of the professional staff of Run’ n Arrow, a group of enthusiastic hunters living in the Peoria, Arizona, area. She is indeed a seasoned hunter and also owes a yacht. She first came on TV after being a cast member of 90 Day Fiance: The Single Life on TLC.</span></p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Candice Mishler Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Candice Mishler</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>1987</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>36 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Arizona, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Hunter, Fisher & TV Personality</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 6” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 168 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 55 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 121 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Candice-Mishler-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Who is her husband?</td><td>Josh Weinstein (Ex.)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Jett Mishler</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><b>Personal Life</b></h3><p><span>Candice Mishler was a happy-living married woman until her husband had an affair with another woman.

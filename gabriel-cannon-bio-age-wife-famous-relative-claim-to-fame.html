The article below is about Gabriel Cannon, who revealed in-game that his celebrity relative is his pro-athlete brother.</p><p>Continue reading to find out about Gabriel’s celebrity relatives and other details about him.</p><h3><strong>Gabriel Cannon On Claim To Fame Season 2</strong></h3><p>Hosted by Kevin and Franklin Jonas, Claim To Fame Season 2 began with an opening ceremony where each cast told two truths and a lie about their famous relative.</p><p>The first challenge was a talent show. Travis won the challenge, thus being safe at the Guess-Off. Hugo and JR finished last place, with Hugo being selected as the season’s first Guesser.</p><p>During the Guess-Off, Hugo targeted Carly and correctly guessed that her famous relative connection was none other than Forest Gump actor Tom Hanks.</p><p>As Carly bid a tearful goodbye to the show, she made sure to let Hugo know that she was upset he had targeted her. “I helped you, Hugo… I gave you clues, and if any of them are right, I swear I hope you go home because of that,” Carly said.</p><h3><strong>Is Nick Cannon Gabriel Cannon’s Famous Relative?</strong></h3><p>During the “Two Truths and a Lie” segment, Gabriel told his castmates that his celebrity relative is his brother.

He also noted that he looks nothing like his brother.</p><p>Although someone is yet to guess Gabriel’s celebrity relative in Claim to Fame Season 2, a non-athlete guess leads to Nick Cannon, who apparently has several NAACP awards under his belt.</p><p>While Gabriel’s Instagram is private and has no pictures with Nick, his brother’s social media are not. Gabriel and Nick can be spotted together in several pictures.</p><p>Nick, a TV host, actor, rapper, and comedian, started his career as a child actor for the Nickelodeon series, All That. In the later part of his career, he got to host The Nick Cannon Show, Wild ‘n Out, America’s Got Talent, Lip Sync Battle Shorties, and The Masked Singer.</p><p>In his interview with Rapzilla in 2017, Gabriel revealed that he idolized his brother Nick as a child and a teenager. He said that he even tried talking like Nick at one point.</p><p>Besides Gabriel and Nick, there are 3 more brothers in the Cannon family, namely Reuben, Javen, and Caleb. Reuben has made a career in music, releasing singles and music videos on YouTube and Instagram; and Javen worked as a production assistant for Wild ‘n Out and as a recurring cast member from season 13 to season 16 before working as a radio host.</p><h3><strong>Gabriel Cannon Age</strong></h3><p>Born in 1986, Gabriel Cannon’s age was 36 at the time of this writing in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Gabriel Cannon Wife</strong></h3><p>Talking about Gabe’s personal life, he has a daughter Mayara Cannon. He and his ex-girlfriend Monica Danger Leon welcomed Mayara on October 16, 2009. Shutting down all the rumors saying Ray-J was the father of the child, Monica confirmed a month before the birth of the baby that the father was indeed Gabriel.</p><p>Monica, who is best known for her performances in For the Love of Ray J, U Got Played, and Crackula Goes to Hollywood, was admitted to a psychiatric hospital after she suddenly shaved her head after having an argument with her baby Mayara’s father, Gabriel.</p><p>Furthermore, Gabriel was arrested on May 9, 2011, in North Hollywood for attempting to steal video camera equipment. As reported by Entertainment Tonight, Gabriel and some unknown accomplices tried taking jewelry from the victims Alex and Alejo Moreno but instead took video equipment.</p><h3><strong>Gabriel Cannon Job</strong></h3><p>Gabriel is an actor and rapper by profession. His Facebook handle shows that he previously worked at Ncredible Entertainment.</p><p>As per Gabriel’s interview with Rapzilla, he and his brother grew up in the church and made music from an early age. Some of the songs Gabriel wrote and sang are Bow My Head, Say Grace, Oh My, Paper Boy, and Road Map, to name a few.</p><p>By the time Gabriel finished high school, Nick had already gone into Hollywood and was hosting MTV’s Wild ‘N Out. Therefore, Nick employed his brothers, including Gabe, to work on Wild ‘N Out in different positions.</p><p>As an actor, Gabriel has given his performances in Love and War, Command 357, and Even Money.</p><p>The Claim to Fame star received education from Calvary Chapel Bible College and Los Angeles Pierce College.</p><h3><strong>How Much Is Gabriel Cannon Net Worth?</strong></h3><p>As of 2023, Gabriel Cannon’s net worth was estimated to be under $350 thousand.</p><h3><strong>Gabriel Cannon Height</strong></h3><p>Claim to Fame fame Gabriel Cannon stands extremely tall at a height of 6 feet 3 inches.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Gabriel Cannon Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>A brother of Gabriel, Chris Major, wished the star of Claim to Fame a happy birthday on December 31st, 2022.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Gabriel Cannon On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Gabriel can be found on Instagram <a href=#>@gabrielcannonmusic</a>, where he has more than 11 thousand followers.

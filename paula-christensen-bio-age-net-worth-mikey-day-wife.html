Netflix’s new baking reality competition TV show Is It Cake?, which premiered on the OTT giant on March 18th, sees talented bakers from all around the US create a cake that looks exactly like an everyday object such as a bottle or a shoe. The contestants, then, have to trick a panel of celebrities into thinking it’s the real object and not a cake. Since SNL’s Mikey Day has hosted the new Netflix show, it’s only natural that the viewers are interested to know about his love life. Today, we bring to you a wiki article about Mikey’s partner Paula Christensen.</p><p>Learn about Paula’s age, job, her personal life with Mikey, and much more.</p><h3><strong>Meet Paula Christensen, Is It Cake? Host Mikey Day Wife</strong></h3><p>Reportedly, Mikey Day met his partner (and reportedly his wife), Paula Christensen,&nbsp;in 2010 way before he joined SNL. The duo has been together ever since. Paula took to Instagram on October 30, 2017, to share a sweet message on seven-year of their togetherness. She wrote, “Seven years with this gem of a human being. Feels like less because it’s still so much fun. Feels like more, because he’s my forever friend. He has a heart of gold and makes the sunshine every day. I love you @mikeyfuntime!”</p><p>The pair welcomed a child, a son, Abbott Adhemar Day, on August 17, 2012. Mikey shared a picture of the baby and baby momma on his Facebook and wrote, “Ladies, lookout. Abbott Adhemar Day. Born August 17, 2012, at 10:41 PM. 7 lbs 11 oz of cute-sauce.”</p><p>Mikey wished his son, Abbott, now 9, a happy 6th birthday by making an Instagram post in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Paula-Christensen1-293x300.jpg><p>Mikey and Paula are equally smitten with each other and Paula never hesitates to show any appreciation for how great of a guy she’s got. One time, she wrote, ” Love you, baby. So glad I get to through this leg of our journey together,” as an appreciation Instagram post for Mikey.</p><p>However, as of this writing, their relationship status was not clear meaning we did not know if the pair were still dating, engaged, or married. Since Paula does not seem to have any sort of ring in her hand in any of her Instagram pictures, it’s unlikely the couple is engaged or married.</p><p>Paula Christensen’s partner Mikey Day did his high schooling at El Modena High School and later graduated with a degree in theater from the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p>Mikey started his career with a Los Angeles-based improvisational theater group called the Groundlings. Before Mikey began his SNL days, he wrote for Showtime’s The Underground, Cartoon Network’s Incredible Crew, Adult Swim’s Robot Chicken. He also starred in NBC’s Kath and Kim remake, NBC variety shows Maya and Marty, and hosted a recurring segment parodying TMZ from 2010 to 2013.</p><p>It was in 2013 when Mikey joined Saturday Night Live (during the 39th season) as a writer. In SNL’s 42nd season, Mikey was promoted to a featured player and repertory player in the show’s 44th season. Some of the popular celebrity impressions done by Mikey on SNL are of Travis Barker, Jack Dorsey, Steve Bannon, Matt Duffer, among others.</p><h3><strong>Paula Christensen Age</strong></h3><p>While we don’t know Paula Christensen’s exact age, she was definitely after 1980 which means her age is 41 or below.</p><h3><strong>Paula Christensen Job</strong></h3><p>Paula Christensen received her education from Amherst College. She graduated Magna Cum Laude with a degree in Theater, Dance, and Anthropology.</p><p>Mikey’s partner Paula is best known for her performances as an actress. As of this writing, some of her popular acting credits include Modern Family, FBI, Tres, Partners, Cannabis Moms Club, among others.</p><p>She also produced some movies in association with a production company that she started with actress Melissa Lee, which is no longer in existence.</p><p>Paula’s directorial debut was based on the published poetry of her grandfather, Carlos Hugo Christensen.</p><h4><strong>How Much Is Paula Christensen Net Worth?</strong></h4><p>Unfortunately, as of this writing, Paula Christensen’s net worth was still under wraps. However, we do know that her partner Mikey Day’s net worth was estimated to be around $3 million as of March 2022.</p><h3><strong>Is Paula Christensen On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Paula is on Instagram <a href=#>@thepaulaverse</a>. She had close to 2.3 thousand followers as of this writing. You can find her on Facebook as well.</p><h3><strong>Paula Christensen Family</strong></h3><p>Paula Christensen moved to the United State from Buenos Aires, Argentina at the young age of 2. Although we do not know much about Paula’s dad, her Instagram paints a really good picture of how close she is to her mom. Not only Paula, but Mikey is also equally close to Paula’s mom.</p><p>On Mother’s Day 2020, Mikey shared some of his favorite pictures with his mother-in-law and wrote, “Happy Mother’s Day to my mama, my baby mama, and my mama-in-law! And to all the mamas out there! Heroes among us!” in the caption.</p><p>Paula is the granddaughter of Carlos Hugo Christensen, one of the most prolific filmmakers in Latin American history, and Susana Freyre, another legendary Latin American actress. Carlos is known for his works such as Intruder, Three Lives in Rio, The Yacht Isabel Arrives This Afternoon, whereas Susana is best remembered for her performances in Three Lives in Rio and Leonora of the Seven Seas.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>What Is Paula Christensen Nationality?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As Paula Christensen writes in her Insta bio “Made in Argentina.

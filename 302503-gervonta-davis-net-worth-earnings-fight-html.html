Gervonta Davis has an estimated net worth of $2 million. The amount is an accumulation of salaries he has earned over the years.

He has lost none. Of the 21 matches he has fought in boxing, he has won 20 by knockout and one by the majority decision. At a young age of 24, there is more to come from him. But, how much does Gervonta Davis earn today and how did he earn his net worth of $2 million?</p><h2>Gervonta Davis net worth: How much does he make?</h2><p class=align-left>Professional boxers earn their salaries or make money in various ways. Mostly it is through winning matches, securing sponsorships, and becoming ambassadors of the sport. Boxing is a sport where athletes can make lots of money. But the salaries are everywhere or disorganized. To understand how much Davis makes, you must first know how boxers make their money.</p><p class=align-left>Several variables determine how much pro boxers earn. Some of these include:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/95e8aecf5d994a1c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Danny Masterson net worth 2021: How rich is That '70s Show</span></p></a><ul><li>A person’s skills</li><li>A person’s fame</li><li>Weight division</li></ul><p class=align-left>If a boxer fulfills the first two and is a heavyweight, he is going to earn more money. But that is not all. Before a boxing match begins, promoters have a purse bid or a boxing purse. In this case, sponsors submit their bids for how much they are willing to pay in the purses.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> How much is Tracy Lord worth?</p><p class=align-left>Once the highest bidder gets the rights to put on the fight, the fighters will split the bid. The bid is mostly split based on a preset formula. Only a few people know the formula. For example, one boxer may get 70% of the money or both may split it 50/50.</p><h2>Gervonta Davis' earnings per fight</h2><p class=align-left>Here is a look at the most popular Gervonta's previous fights and how much he earned.</p><h3>Gervonta Davis vs. Pedraza</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/9878d43a6a20bb18.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>David Goggins net worth and how he makes his money</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The fight happened on January 14, 2017. It was Davis’ first professional match to be broadcasted on ESPN. He was facing Pedraza who was undefeated at that time. Davis won the fight on the seventh round through a knockout. He won the IBF Junior Lightweight title.</p><p class=align-left>He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">earned $75,000</a> for the match. Pedraza, who had lost the fight, earned $225,000. The average number of viewers for the bout was around 344,000.</p><h3>Gervonta Davis vs. Fonseca</h3><p class=align-left>Davis fought Fonseca on August 26, 2017. At that time, the IBF had ranked Fonseca at number 7 and was unbeaten. Before the bout, each fighter had to have a weight limit of 130 pounds, but Davis had 132 pounds. He refused to weigh in, and this forced the IBF to strip him of his title declaring it vacant.</p><p class=align-left>Davis was the favorite candidate for the fight. He won on the eighth round. Because of his popularity and the purse size, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">earned $600,000</a>. Fonseca only received a paltry $35,000.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f35fccd1bd7a43fc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>WWE superstars salary per match: Who is the highest paid wrestler?</span></p></a><h3>Gervonta Davis vs. Cuellar</h3><p class=align-left>On April 21, 2018, Davis fought Jesus Cuellar for the WBA (Super) super featherweight title. At that time, Cuellar was a former featherweight champion with a record of 28-2, 21 KOs. The match took place at the Barclays Center, New York City in front of over 13,000 people. It was also a match that attracted over 520,000 viewers.</p><p class=align-left>Davis won the fight by knocking out Cuellar on the third round. He did it by landing 49% of his power shots to his opponent. Because both fighters were popular at that time, they shared the purse. The boxers earned <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$350,000 apiece.</a></p><h3>Gervonta Davis vs. Ruiz</h3><p class=align-left>Davis fought Hugo Ruiz on February 9, 2019, at the Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, California. Initially, Davis was to defend his title against Abner Mares who is a former three-weight world champion. Mares pulled out of the fight ten days before due to a detached retina. Hugo Ruiz came as a favorite despite having fought three weeks earlier.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d2a4e8f3147c6cb2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>British stand-up comedian Ricky Gervais net worth in 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Davis was the favorite to win from the word go.

For the fight, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">he made $1 million</a> while Ruiz made $100,000.</p><p class=align-left>The above four are bouts where the purse size was known to the public. In essence, Gervonta Davis has faced 21 different opponents and defeated them all. He has also won and retained two titles namely the IBF super featherweight title and the WBA (Super) super featherweight title.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Johnny Depp net worth and career earnings</p><p class=align-left>One fight that had a big purse size was between Davis and Liam Walsh.

But the event attracted an average audience of over 250,000 viewers on Showtime.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ce3d19e31b811567.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Manny Pacquiao purse earnings per fight and current net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>From the above numbers, it is not easy to tell the exact Gervonta Davis salary per fight. The salary amounts are everywhere. For example, after earning $75,000 vs. Jose Pedraza, he went on to receive $600,000 on his match against Fonseca. He could probably make more or less on his next fight. It will all depend on factors like</p><ul><li>His contract</li><li>Revenue generated through Pay-Per-View and Television rights</li><li>Ranking</li><li>Popularity</li><li>Sponsorships</li><li>Fighting location</li><li>Opponent</li></ul><p class=align-left>As such, it is impossible to predict his exact salary. However, Gervonta Davis net worth is more likely to increase as he gains more popularity. This is because the most popular fighters always get an upper hand.</p><h2>House</h2><p class=align-left>Gervonta Davis’ place of residence is in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. It is a place where he was born and raised. Since his professional debut, he has trained in various gyms across the USA. The known ones are the Upton Boxing Center in Baltimore and the Goossen Gym in Los Angeles.

Like other boxers, he signed with various boxing promoters that put him on the map. Boxing promoters are, in essence, matchmakers. Part of their job is to scout for talented boxers. After spotting them, they sign them up for several fights and arrange the logistics.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2aa43f620de72e15.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Floyd Mayweather net worth in 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The promoters arrange for the date, time, and venue of the fight. Also, they find sponsors who will bankroll the costs incurred. It is for this reason that many pro boxers have few sponsorship deals. Promoters arrange everything. Davis is no exception.</p><h3>Al Haymon</h3><p class=align-left>When he began his professional career, Gervonta Davis signed for Al Haymon in 2014. Al Haymon is a boxing promoter and manager. He has signed and advised many pro boxers over the years. Two notable once include Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao.

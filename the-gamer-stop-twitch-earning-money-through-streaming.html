We are all aware of how to create content, and how to earn money through these platforms. Have you ever sat and thought why these platforms are much more easier to adapt to then Twitch? I’ll give you my answer on this. These popular platforms offer you an opportunity to filter the way you present your content and in turn yourself. You can edit, alter, change elements of your shares, and plan ahead. However, Twitch is a live-streaming platform, it is more real than the others, and it is unfiltered, unless you are using some sort of software to filter yourself.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/inflownetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Twitch-Earning-Money-Through-Streaming-2-1024x576.jpg alt="Twitch & Earning Money Through Streaming" width=1024 height=576 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>But what is Twitch?</h2><p><span>The famous live streaming app has been around for some time, and it is mainly used by gamers and eSports lovers. Think of it like the new TV where only the games you want to watch are displayed, and you can actually connect with the players. Twitch is also the first platform for gamers to live-stream properly which is why it actually got quite popular. It is as if YouTube was a platform with only live-streams.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Even though Twitch is popular among gamers and esports lovers, there are also various channels on DIY, lifestyle and more on Twitch, but they are not as popular as the game streamers.</span></p><p><span>The most asked question on Twitch is why anyone would watch someone play a video game. The most basic answer is to learn something about the game, a trick or a tip to use in your own games. Another reason is that these gamers usually have a chance to play these games before other people, aka they receive PR packages, and they can play to see if the game is actually worth the price or time it takes. It is also the same concept as watching a sports game on TV, you just watch it on your computer, and it is free.</span></p><h2>How do you make money on Twitch?</h2><p><span>There are several ways to make money through Twitch. The first way is to receive donations from your viewers. Your audience can donate you some money via various payment options while you’re streaming to support you.</span></p><p><span>If you have enough viewers, and you are popular enough on Twitch, you might also start getting brand subscriptions. Don’t think of these brands as only game companies though, any brand could be interested in your live-stream. So be open to new sectors & opportunities. A way for brands to collaborate with smaller influencers is affiliate marketing, and this applies to Twitch streamers as well. You could earn a commission through a product you mention in your stream, so it is important to look out for the affiliate programs of brands and see if there are any that your profile could fit in.</span></p><p><span>But the real way to earn money on Twitch is through becoming a Twitch Affiliate. Similar to YouTube, when your streams and profile is at a certain level, you become a Twitch Affiliate. To become one, you have to have:</span></p><ul><li aria-level=1><span>At least 500Min of live-streams in the last 30 days</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>At least 7 unique broadcast days in the last 30 days</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>An average of 3 concurrent viewers or more in the last 30 days</span></li><li aria-level=1><span>At least 50 followers</span></li></ul><p><span>Once you are a Twitch Affiliate, you can earn money through subscriptions, ads, and bits. Similar to YouTube in so many ways, the subscriptions are for your “VIP” viewers who would like to be in an exclusive group chat, who can get a discount on your merchandise if you make any and more.</span></p><p><span>The ads are the advertisements that pop up in your streams. You can get a share of the revenue of these ads while you are streaming.</span></p><p><span>And the bits are again similar to donations, where your viewers can cheer you on with a “bit”, and you earn 1 cent per “bit” used to cheer you on by your viewers.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You can read more details and see what you can and can’t do as an affiliate on this <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>here.</a></strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Apart from these, once you are a well-known streamer, and have a loyal audience, you can think of creating merch as your brand. Most streamers & YouTubers sell merch as a way to both make money, and make the audience feel part of the family. Be careful though, as if your merch goes wrong, there goes your reputations too.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Let us know if you have questions about streaming on Twitch, and what you actually think about the platform. Do you think it’s worth the effort to become a Twitch affiliate, or would you just stay as a viewer, and enjoy the show.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnpu5sMPNnquwp6Kge6S7zGiroZ1dnK6usdFmqq2noGLBuLXTnJ9mnZGnu6q6xmakqKaVrnq1tNGorKCgXajBs7HApqCnn18%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-gamer-stop-twitch-earning-money-through-streaming.html&text=The%20Gamer%20Stop%3a%20Twitch%20%26amp%3b%20Earning%20Money%20Through%20Streaming&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-gamer-stop-twitch-earning-money-through-streaming.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-gamer-stop-twitch-earning-money-through-streaming.html&title=The%20Gamer%20Stop%3a%20Twitch%20%26amp%3b%20Earning%20Money%20Through%20Streaming" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-gamer-stop-twitch-earning-money-through-streaming.html&title=The%20Gamer%20Stop%3a%20Twitch%20%26amp%3b%20Earning%20Money%20Through%20Streaming" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-gamer-stop-twitch-earning-money-through-streaming.html&title=The%20Gamer%20Stop%3a%20Twitch%20%26amp%3b%20Earning%20Money%20Through%20Streaming" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-gamer-stop-twitch-earning-money-through-streaming.html&description=The%20Gamer%20Stop%3a%20Twitch%20%26amp%3b%20Earning%20Money%20Through%20Streaming" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cristine-reyes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Cristine Reyes dating?

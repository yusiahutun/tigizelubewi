The actor went inside and found Murciano watching The Black Eyed Peas' "Hey Mama" video. Referring to Fergie, Murciano said, "This girl shakes it like she wants a career" and Duhamel agreed (?).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Duhamel told Anderson Live host Anderson Cooper</a> that he had a crush on the singer from that point on — and he wasn't shy about it. He went on to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>tell InStyle</a>, "My recurring dream involves the lead singer of The Black Eyed Peas. Oh, my god, I've got the biggest crush on her! God, she is hot!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Driven by his crush, Duhamel spoke with Las Vegas producers and suggested they book The Black Eyed Peas for an episode of the show. Evidently the actor is very persuasive; the Peas appeared in an episode of the show's second season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On set, Duhamel opted for, uh, flattery. When he finally met Fergie,<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> he told her, "You're hot."</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The crush of a lifetime, and that was my line!" Duhamel lamented in an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>interview with Best Life</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lucky for him, Fergie had heard about Duhamel's crush and told the actor, "Yeah, I read InStyle. So … how was I in your dream?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"All my friends knew about him because he had been a soap opera star," Fergie explained in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2007 interview with Playboy</a>. "I'm not into soap operas, but they told me, 'You gotta go out with him. Do it for the group. Take one for the team.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once they finally met, she said they "pretty much hit it off straight away."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Josh Duhamel, Fergie.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>George Pimentel/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the end of 2007, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a> reported that the couple was engaged. The actor proposed with a diamond ring <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>engraved with "J heart S."</a> "I feel like the happiest, luckiest girl in the world," Fergie told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Glamour</a> a few months later. "The ring is still too big."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Duhamel and Fergie tied the knot in January 2009</a> at a ceremony in Malibu.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Four years later, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Fergie announced that she and her husband were expecting their first child together</a>. They welcomed son Axl Jack in August 2013.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them:</strong> Married life got off to a rocky start. Less than 10 months in, Atlanta stripper <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nicole Forrester told The National Enquirer that she'd had an affair with Duhamel</a>. Both Duhamel and Fergie vehemently denied the allegation, but the story persisted in the media.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But they didn't let the negative attention derail their relationship. They <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>renewed their vows</a> the following January and emerged stronger than ever.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When you go through difficult times, it really makes you stronger as a unit," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Fergie told Oprah Winfrey</a> of how her and Duhamel's marriage thrived in the aftermath of the tabloid coverage. "Our love today is a deeper love."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, this didn't happen overnight. Fergie admitted that she and her husband went to "a lot of therapy," but that the ordeal ultimately "became a positive for us."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Duhamel echoed his wife's sentiment. "I'm actually happy that all that happened because we wouldn't be as strong as we are now; we wouldn't be as happy as we are now," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Oprah</a>. "In a lot of ways it made me straighten my ass out."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> Duhamel and Fergie were always delightfully candid, but this gem from the latter's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2015 Allure cover story</a> might be our favorite overshare from the couple.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fergie revealed that Duhamel once walked in on her during a bikini wax, and his reaction was … unexpected. "I'm like, 'OK, honey, hi,'" she said. "And I'm on all fours … But he doesn't just leave; he gets curious!" Is this the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>dual toilets anecdote</a> of 2015?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On a less TMI level, both parties had discussed a sweet pastime of theirs: singing to their dachshunds, Meatloaf and Zoe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We make up our own songs about our dogs," Fergie told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>E! News</a> in 2011.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Duhamel (rightfully) praised Fergie's skill as a canine chanteuse.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Fergie will sing ballads to the dogs and they'll sit there rapt," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Redbook</a> in 2011. "You know your wife's a star when she keeps the dogs entertained for 20 minutes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:</strong> In September 2017, after eight years of marriage, Duhamel and Fergie announced that they'd separated earlier that year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"With absolute love and respect we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year," they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>shared in a joint statement</a>. "To give our family the best opportunity to adjust, we wanted to keep this a private matter before sharing it with the public. We are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Josh Duhamel, Fergie.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images for Relativity Media</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, the announcement coincided with Fergie's press tour for her long-awaited sophomore solo album, Double Dutchess, so avoiding breakup q's was pretty much off the table.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later that month, Fergie told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Entertainment Tonight</a> that she and Duhamel were still "great friends" and that the only thing that had changed between them was their romantic status.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There's so much love we have for each other," she said. "We really like each other; we have fun with each other; we're just not a romantic couple anymore."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>a visit to The Wendy Williams Show</a> that October, Fergie tearfully explained that the separation "wasn't my plan" and that she "wanted to stay married forever."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Their commitment to co-parenting never faltered, and the exes even joined forces for Axl's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>superhero-themed fifth birthday party</a> the following year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Duhamel remained Fergie's biggest fan, too. The actor visited the Ellen DeGeneres Show soon after his ex-wife's maligned national anthem performance and stood up for the singer. "The girl is crazy talented," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he said</a>. "She's an amazing woman. It's hard to see someone you care about get beat up like that." Still, he assured DeGeneres that she would bounce back from the vitriol. "She is about as resilient as they come."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Duhamel released his directorial debut, Buddy Games, fans noticed that the actor's ex received a special thanks credit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She was the one who said, 'You know what? You can direct this. You can do this,'" Duhamel told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Today</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_77-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When we were doing the final credits, I go, 'You know what? I gotta give Ferg a little shoutout' because she was somebody who told me to go do it," he went on. "Because honestly, I wasn't sure if I could."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_79-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now:</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_81-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Duhamel got engaged to Audra Mari in early 2022, and Fergie even shared her enthusiastic "Congrats!!!" on the actor's Instagram post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_83-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor is currently starring in NBC's The Thing About Pam and will appear in Jennifer Lopez rom-com Shotgun Wedding this summer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_85-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fergie's current relationship status is unknown. Any plans for a Triple Dutchess are also undisclosed, and the singer seems to be focusing on family at the moment, which includes her involvement with Ferguson Crest — the winery she founded with her late father, Pat Ferguson.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_87-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">#TBT: Check in every Thursday as we throw it back to some of our favorite celebrity couples of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9Obq2aelae0qrGMo6asoF2ZwqmtzJ6jZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftbt-fergie-josh-duhamel-relationship.html&text=TBT%3a%20Fergie%20and%20Josh%20Duhamel&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftbt-fergie-josh-duhamel-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftbt-fergie-josh-duhamel-relationship.html&title=TBT%3a%20Fergie%20and%20Josh%20Duhamel" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftbt-fergie-josh-duhamel-relationship.html&title=TBT%3a%20Fergie%20and%20Josh%20Duhamel" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftbt-fergie-josh-duhamel-relationship.html&title=TBT%3a%20Fergie%20and%20Josh%20Duhamel" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftbt-fergie-josh-duhamel-relationship.html&description=TBT%3a%20Fergie%20and%20Josh%20Duhamel" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cara-delevingne-and-rihannas-valerian-film-trailer-is-here.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Valerian film trailer starring Rihanna and Cara Delevingne">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gabriel-cannon-bio-age-wife-famous-relative-claim-to-fame.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Claim To Fame Gabriel Cannon!

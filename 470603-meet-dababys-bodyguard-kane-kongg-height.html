He has been with DaBaby since he started hismusic career and has protected him in public events on many occasions. Here are some quick facts about DaBaby’s bodyguard.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Follow us on <a href=# title="Instagram - Tuko" rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> - get the most important news directly in your favourite app!</p><h3>1. Kane Kongg is tall and heavy</h3><p class=align-left>Like many personal <a href=#>security</a> guards, he is tall and heavy. Kane Kong’s height is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">6 feet 9 inches</a>, and his weight is 400 pounds. His height and weight are incomparable to his client DaBaby, who is only feet 8 inches or 173 centimetres and weighs 165 pounds or 75 kilograms.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7be42e4029758350.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Anthony Strangis and where is he today?</span></p></a><h3>2. The bodyguard likes toying around with DaBaby</h3><p class=align-left>Kane Kongg and DaBaby complement each other. The two like toying around and have uploaded many videos on YouTube. For example, DaBaby once roasted his bodyguard for being fat and even took a weight scale to measure his weight.</p><p class=align-left>DaBaby wrestled his bodyguard in another incident because he wanted some ice cream. Eventually, DaBaby stole the ice cream, making Kane Kongg disappointed. Also, the two uploaded another video where he said he would press charges against his bodyguard for felony assault after swinging him while seated in an aeroplane. Nothing happened eventually.</p><p class=align-left>DaBaby once teased Kane after the bodyguard broke up with his girlfriend. However, whether the woman was Kane Kong’s wife was not apparent. The two have an excellent and <a href=#>comical relationship</a>, a factor that many bodyguards do not share with their clients.</p><p class=align-left>They have many videos on YouTube playing with each other, including throwing him in a van and choking him. Also, the two were in Greece having a good time when DaBaby laughed at his bodyguard for being scared of getting in a helicopter.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0672720540634685.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=32><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>YNW Melly: net worth, height, mom, brother, songs, what happened</span></p></a><h3>3. Kane was part of a security team that beat a man to a coma</h3><p class=align-left>In 2019, a fan named <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Don Trag</a> faced the wrath of DaBaby’s security team when they beat him and left him fighting for his life in hospital. The incident, outside Centro Nightclub in Lawrence, Massachusetts, started when Trag allegedly became overzealous in trying to get a photo with DaBaby.</p><p class=align-left>Tag insisted on taking a photo with DaBaby, but his security team, which includes Kane Kongg, turned him down. He persisted with no effort and started throwing insults at DaBaby’s security team. At that point, they started beating him, sustaining many blows to his head and body. The beating continued as DaBaby watched.</p><p class=align-left>The tag was hospitalised that night and later released into his mother’s care. Unfortunately, his mother claimed Trag collapsed hours after the attack at her home in Boston. Also, Trag’s brother said that Trag suffered significant brain and neck swelling and was not doing well. Does Kane Kongg still work for DaBaby? As of 2022, Kane still works for DaBaby.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b38692bbdb32c161.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ross O'Donovan: divorce story, wife, sister, net worth, Game Grumps</span></p></a><h3>4. He once knocked a woman unconscious</h3><p class=align-left>In another incident in 2019, Kane punched an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">overzealous female fan</a> and made her unconscious. The altercation happened when DaBaby performed at the Freewater Block Party in New Orleans. DaBaby entered the crowd, and a female fan reached out to him for a photo. The woman smiled and spoke to him. Then, Kane Kongg flaked DaBaby’s left side.</p><p class=align-left>Another woman appeared to hit out DaBaby, forcing the <a href=#>rapper</a> to push her away. But, instead of stopping, she kept touching him. That is when Kane Kongg stepped in to protect DaBaby. Kane intervened by raining punches on her. The woman fell and was left unconscious, surrounded by fans. She stayed on the ground for a minute as paramedics treated her at the scene.</p><p class=align-left>Kane received backlash several days later, with many people suggesting that she should not have hit a woman three times smaller. But he later addressed the backlash, insisting he was only protecting his client from physical harm.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b66a06a2467401e5.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is Ryan Paevey married?

The woman had separated from her husband.</p><p class=align-left>She even showed proof of direct messages between her and her celebrity crush. However, Kane Kongg never responded to the video, and whether those allegations were true remains unknown.</p><h3>6. Kane enjoys a massive social media following</h3><p class=align-left>Kane is a bodyguard, and one would expect him to do his work of protecting his client. While there is no doubt that he does an excellent job, he has used his client’s celebrity status to amass a large following on social media.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike many <a href=#>celebrity bodyguards</a>, Kane Kongg is now a celebrity himself. His Instagram account has over 600,000 followers, Facebook has over 450,000 followers, and a YouTube channel with over 9,000 subscribers and 180,000 video views.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a230c17b4f18435c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is David Bromstad's partner?

For example, he sells supplements, syrups, water, and beard oil. Furthermore, the bodyguard has an<a href=#> e-book</a> titled <i>Bodyguard Lessons And Guides</i>.</p><p class=align-left>How much does Kane Kongg make?

However, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Salary.com</a>, the average bodyguard salary in the United States is $67,967 as of 26 July 2022.</p><p class=align-left>DaBaby’s bodyguard as of 2022 is Kane Kongg. He has protected DaBaby in public on many occasions and even punched a woman unconscious. And despite being a bodyguard, Kane Kongg is somewhat of a celebrity who enjoys a massive social media following. It is easy to point out Kane Kongg whenever he is in public with DaBaby because he is a 400-pound, 6 feet 9 inches giant.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e170222373123f8d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tony Hinchcliffe: Wife, gay, net worth, family, stand up comedy</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> recently published an article about<a href=#> 2Baba's bio</a>: wife, children, net worth, house, and cars. 2Baba is a well-known Nigerian <a href=#>musician</a>, singer, songwriter, record producer, entrepreneur, philanthropist, humanitarian, and activist who has inspired a lot of Africans and Nigerians.</p><p class=align-left>His full name is Innocent Ujah Idibia and is 47years old (as of 2022).

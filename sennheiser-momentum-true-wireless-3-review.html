Despite charging as much as $50 more than any of the big three, Sennheiser hopes to overcome the greater brand recognition of its primary competitors by focusing instead on its "Sennheiser signature sound," use of Qualcomm's high-resolution <a href=#>aptX Adaptive audio codec</a>, and fully adjustable equalizer presets.</p><p>Unfortunately for Sennheiser, there are a few key areas where the MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 earbuds fail to compare.</p><h2 id=fit-lots-of-options-if-not-the-most-comfortable>Fit: Lots of Options, if Not the Most Comfortable</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/46c0e297.jpg> Bill Loguidice / Review Geek <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><b>Earbuds Weight (each): </b>6g (0.21oz)</li><li><b>Charging Case Weight:</b> 66g (2.33oz)</li><li><b>Earbuds Water Resistance: </b>IPX4 (resistant to splashes)</li></ul><p>Opening the box, you're greeted by the pair of earbuds, a charging case and short USB-C cable, a quick guide and safety guide, four ear adapters (rubber tips), and three ear fin (rubber outer band) sets. By default, the medium (M) ear adapters are installed with the medium (M) ear fins.</p><p>For my smaller ears, I was more comfortable with the extra small (XS) ear adapters and small (S) ear fins. Installing the ear adapters and fins was intuitive, with clear markings and quick and easy swapping.</p><p>Despite the options, I never did find the perfect fit for my ears, especially compared to the comfort I enjoy with my usual AirPods Pro. Inserting the MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 earbuds was a bit tricky as well. I needed to place each earbud at a slight forward angle in the ear canal and then give it a slight backward twist. It's a motion I got used to, but something that I never truly felt I perfected, especially because of the sensitivity of the touch controls on the flat sides (<a href=#>more on those touch controls later</a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In any case, it's important to note that because of how deep these go into your ears and the suction the rubber ear adapters create, you'll want to be careful about ear wax. If you have any, these will capture just about every bit of it on the rubber ear adapters.</p><h2 id=charging-and-storage-a-bit-bulky>Charging and Storage: A Bit Bulky</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/5c8d2e16.jpg> Bill Loguidice / Review Geek<ul><li><b>Earbuds battery life: </b>7 hours</li><li><b>Charging case operating time:</b>&nbsp;Up to 28 hours</li></ul><p>As with any device of this type, it's important to fully charge before use. The charging case is a bit bulky in comparison to something like the case that comes with the AirPods Pro, with roughly twice the vertical height, but does support both USB-C charging and <a href=#>Qi-compatible wireless charging</a> from the bottom of the case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, unlike some of its more well-known competition, you're unlikely to find any cool cases, wraps, or other accessories for the included charging case, but it does have a nicely-textured charcoal-colored exterior that helps it feel like a premium product.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/a411a875.jpg> Bill Loguidice / Review Geek<p>The indicator light next to the USB-C port on the front of the case flashes yellow while charging. It changes to solid green once fully charged, which takes about 1 hour and 30 minutes, with every 10 minutes of charging time netting you&nbsp;roughly 1 hour of music playback.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The charging case can store about 21 hours of charging time, while the earbuds themselves can last about 7 hours between charges. Although these battery life numbers are not best-in-class, they're certainly competitive. Of course, those numbers can vary wildly depending on usage and average volume levels.</p><h2 id=setup-it-s-all-about-that-app>Setup: It's All About That App</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><ul><li><b>Bluetooth version: </b>Bluetooth 5.2 compliant, class 1, 10 mW (max)</li><li><b>Bluetooth profiles:</b> A2DP, AVRCP, HFP</li><li><b>Bluetooth audio codec: </b>SBC, AAC, aptX, aptX adaptive</li></ul><p>To pair with your Bluetooth-enabled device, you simply place the earbuds in your ear and then touch and hold each side for three seconds. A cheery, female voice helps guide you by saying "pairing" and "connected." Pairing in this manner allows these <a href=#>Bluetooth 5.2-compliant</a> earbuds to connect with just about any device, but it's recommended that you connect them to a newer iOS, iPadOS, or Android device so you can use Sennheiser's Smart Control app (available for <a href=#>iPhone</a> and <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Android</a>) for customization.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When I first paired the MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 earbuds to my <a href=#>iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>, I was prompted with an "App Not Installed" message. Following the prompt, I installed the app. Once connected, I was directed to update to the latest firmware, which took a lengthy 21 minutes to complete.</p><span class=txt>Close</span><p>Using the app, you can modify how the touch controls respond with each earbud, complete a sound check to tune the sound to your preferred audio profile, and set your equalizer presets, including Bass Boost or Podcast setting---the latter of which enhances speech clarity, primarily with spoken content.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=noise-cancellation-real-limitations>Noise Cancellation: Real Limitations</h2><p>A big feature you're paying for with the MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 earbuds is their noise cancellation capabilities. Unfortunately, its noise cancellation performance is middling at best.</p><p>We tested the noise cancellation capabilities in a variety of settings, but the most demanding was when we took them to our gym. As many do, this gym likes to blast music from speakers spread throughout the facility, which certainly ups the noise levels in addition to the general chatter and clank of the weights and machinery. Using a <a href=#>decibel meter app</a>, we measured peak volume levels of 88db, which is loud enough that your ears can only safely tolerate such levels for a maximum of four hours before you're in danger of hearing loss.</p><p>With the earbuds' Hybrid Adaptive <a href=#>ANC (Active Noise Cancellation)</a>, the gym music was still clearly heard, but reduced to more of a background noise. It definitely helped a little, but did not do enough to compete with the external bass, which passed right through the noise cancellation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, when we turned off the noise cancellation entirely, we noted little difference from the passive noise cancellation provided by the earbuds going deep into the ear canal. If you're looking for better noise cancellation than something like the AirPods Pro offer, the Sennheiser&nbsp;MOMENTUM True Wireless 3's can't provide it.</p><p>For whatever reason, the MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 earbuds did perform well when we used them at the gym's hydro massage bed, which loudly shoots heated jets of water against the waterproof surface you lay down on. There were really no other instances where the noise cancellation worked particularly well. In fact, there's a "wind" setting in the app that seemed to make the noise cancellation worse when in windy conditions rather than better.</p><h2 id=sound-it-s-made-for-music>Sound: It's Made For Music</h2><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><b>Frequency response (speaker)</b>: 5 Hz to 21 kHz</li><li><b>Transducer principle: </b>Dynamic, closed-back</li><li><b>Transducer size: </b>7 mm, TrueResponse</li><li><b>Sound pressure level (SPL)</b>: 107 dB SPL (1 kHz / 1 mW)</li><li><b>Total harmonic distortion (THD): </b>&lt;0.08% (1 kHz / 94 dB SPL)</li><li><b>Frequency response (microphone): </b>100 Hz to 10 kHz</li><li><b>Microphone principle: </b>MEMS</li><li><b>Microphone pick-up pattern: </b>3 mics per earbud, beamforming for noise reduction</li></ul><p>The default sound profile is excellent with great clarity and separation. The bass is not overpowering, which is nice. When used with the app, you really can customize the sound profile to your preferences, including cranking up the bass.</p><p>Podcasts sounded good with the defaults, but they sounded even better with the Podcast setting in the app. Unfortunately, there's no way to assign a tap to turn this feature on or off, so you'll always need to use the app to switch between podcast optimization and music optimization.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Calls were noted as clear with good voice pickup, but those we spoke to did say they could hear a lot of the background noise in our environment. It's hoped that, like with the mediocre noise cancellation performance, voice call quality can be further optimized with future firmware updates. But, as it stands, it's merely passable.</p><h2 id=touch-controls-too-sensitive>Touch Controls: Too Sensitive</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/735df131.jpg> Bill Loguidice / Review Geek<p>While it's great that the touch controls are so configurable using the app, the sensitivity of the response is frustrating. Even with a simple in-ear adjustment of an earbud, it's all but impossible not to inadvertently tap the side and cause something to happen that you didn't want. Even going anywhere near your ear, it's too easy to accidentally brush against, and activate, the touch response of the earbuds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just as frustrating: there's no automatic ear detection. This means when you remove the earbuds from your ear, your device is still connected to it until you manually disconnect or place the earbuds back in their case. Especially at this price point, it really needs a feature like automatic ear detection as an option to be competitive with something like the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Beats Fit Pro</a>.</p><h2 id=are-the-momentum-true-wireless-3-earbuds-worth-it>Are the MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 Earbuds Worth It?</h2><p>At a staggering $249.95, it's reasonable to at least expect feature parity with the major competition like <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href=#>Pixel Buds Pro</a>, and <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Galaxy Buds Pro</a>. Unfortunately, the MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 earbuds fall short of this competition in several key areas like noise cancellation and usability. Even in an area where it should shine, like music playback, it's not noticeably better sounding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">MOMENTUM True Wireless 3</a> earbuds have trouble competing against some of Sennheiser's other, lower-cost products. For instance, the main differentiator between the True Wireless 3 and <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">True Wireless 2</a>, besides $50, is that the True Wireless 2 doesn't feature a wireless charging case. Whether that justifies the extra cost is up to you.</p><p>If you drop down in price by $120, you can get the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">CX Plus True Wireless</a> that loses the high-end sound tuning. If you can live without the transparency mode and active noise cancellation, you can get the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">CX True Wireless</a> for just $79.95. Again, based on how well these work on the MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 earbuds, losing any of these features, particularly for the significant reduction in cost, is probably worth the trade-off.</p><p>Here's the bottom line: if you want an alternative to the major premium earbuds, the Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 earbuds are hard to recommend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/3c3383e8.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 3</h5>$188 <span class=regular-price>$280</span> Save $92<p class=display-card-description></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow sponsored">$188 at Amazon</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhoa2pnZX1wv8SnpaGdmaiys3nMqKSepqSqum7A0a6cZq%2BZp7KtsdKsZGxloprDqrHWaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-review.html&text=Sennheiser%20MOMENTUM%20True%20Wireless%203%20Review%3a%20Good%20Sound%2c%20Poor%20Noise%20Cancellation&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-review.html&title=Sennheiser%20MOMENTUM%20True%20Wireless%203%20Review%3a%20Good%20Sound%2c%20Poor%20Noise%20Cancellation" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-review.html&title=Sennheiser%20MOMENTUM%20True%20Wireless%203%20Review%3a%20Good%20Sound%2c%20Poor%20Noise%20Cancellation" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-review.html&title=Sennheiser%20MOMENTUM%20True%20Wireless%203%20Review%3a%20Good%20Sound%2c%20Poor%20Noise%20Cancellation" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-3-review.html&description=Sennheiser%20MOMENTUM%20True%20Wireless%203%20Review%3a%20Good%20Sound%2c%20Poor%20Noise%20Cancellation" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-real-meaning-of-self-love.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Real Meaning of Self-Love">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./not-just-a-hill-of-beans-qc-coffee-trail-showcases-shops-cafes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Not just a hill of beans: QC Coffee Trail showcases shops, cafes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

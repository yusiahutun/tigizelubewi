There were 3,781 recorded hospital admissions in the UK for bunion surgery among men, and 29,258 admissions for women, in 2013. According to NHS statistics, surgery improves symptoms in 85 per cent of cases.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>There are many different procedures available — more than 100 according to BUPA — none of which sound desperately appealing; shaving off the side of the toe to reduce the bump and/or pinning the toe back into place.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Your surgeon will tailor your procedure to you,' says Emma Supple. 'You can often have surgery under a local anaesthetic and be treated as a day patient.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>A common correction of a bunion is a Scarfe Akin procedure, which involves repositioning the bone and inserting tiny screws into the new position. This means that you can walk almost immediately after surgery.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Although the procedure may sound straightforward, you are looking at up to three months of not being able to drive.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'It takes six weeks for bone to heal,' she says. 'You'll spend two weeks in a surgical boot and the next four weeks pottering around in an oversized trainer — your foot is still swollen and bandaged. After three months you ought to be back in normal shoes.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'That means whatever feels comfortable (and with your surgeon's advice). If you're able to wear stilettos again, then do. It's unlikely that the bunions will come back — only very occasionally is this a complication.'</span></p><h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead tvshowbiz-ccox"><span>WILL EXERCISES BE OF ANY HELP?</span></h2><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Anyone with the slightest indication of bunions should try the following exercises, recommended by Dr Khan.</span></p><li><span>Sit with your feet out in front of you with a rubber band held between your two big toes. Pull feet away from each other so toes are straight. Do for two minutes twice a day.</span></li><li><span>Stand on tissue paper and gather it up with your big toe. This exercises all the muscles in the foot and helps to redevelop the muscles in the arch of the foot.</span></li><li><span>Stand facing a wall. Rise onto your tip toes and hold for two minutes. This stretch works the deep muscle in the back of the leg which runs all the way from behind the knee to the ball of the foot,s and helps to keep the toe supple.&nbsp;</span></li><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKymqLWww8GisWiZoqm2pLjEZmprbWZufnV7oKaYpWWSqruqu81mmauhl5axpnmsq6pme5ykvK%2Bx2GaqZqafqXq0wMCrZK2nn6nAqrGMramorZKhsm6v1KucZpqlnK%2BmrdFnn62lnA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2famal-bunion-brigade-mrs-clooney-s-not-star-tootsie-trouble-cure-bugbear-html.html&text=Geoge%20Clooney%27s%20wife%20Amal%27s%20not%20the%20only%20star%20with%20bunion%20trouble&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famal-bunion-brigade-mrs-clooney-s-not-star-tootsie-trouble-cure-bugbear-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2famal-bunion-brigade-mrs-clooney-s-not-star-tootsie-trouble-cure-bugbear-html.html&title=Geoge%20Clooney%27s%20wife%20Amal%27s%20not%20the%20only%20star%20with%20bunion%20trouble" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2famal-bunion-brigade-mrs-clooney-s-not-star-tootsie-trouble-cure-bugbear-html.html&title=Geoge%20Clooney%27s%20wife%20Amal%27s%20not%20the%20only%20star%20with%20bunion%20trouble" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2famal-bunion-brigade-mrs-clooney-s-not-star-tootsie-trouble-cure-bugbear-html.html&title=Geoge%20Clooney%27s%20wife%20Amal%27s%20not%20the%20only%20star%20with%20bunion%20trouble" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famal-bunion-brigade-mrs-clooney-s-not-star-tootsie-trouble-cure-bugbear-html.html&description=Geoge%20Clooney%27s%20wife%20Amal%27s%20not%20the%20only%20star%20with%20bunion%20trouble" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hailey-clauson-and-julian-herrera-personal-trainer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hailey Clauson and Julian Herrera (personal trainer)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./6619054be2704e94b98b45d7-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="F1: En Red Bull ponen a Tsunoda &amp;quot;al nivel de Verstappen y Alonso&amp;quot; en Suzuka">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

The question is, which one should you opt for?</p><h2 id=advantages-of-custom-mechanical-keyboards>Advantages of Custom Mechanical Keyboards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/best-mechanical-keyboards.jpg><p>To get a premium keyboard with specific features, consider building your own mechanical one. Here are the advantages of custom mechanical keyboards.</p><h3 id=unique-design>Unique Design</h3><p>One major advantage of building your own mechanical keyboard is the ability to choose from many different case materials, whereas pre-built keyboards are mostly available in plastic and aluminum.</p><p>Building your own keyboard lets you opt for materials like wood, brass, and ceramic coating, enhancing its aesthetics and typing sound. It also means more keycap designs and color choices.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Custom keyboards allow you to <a href=#>choose keycaps based on your preferences</a>, like your favorite game, movie, or color. You can buy keycaps from stores like Drop for unique options, Osume for limited minimalist editions, and Akko for affordable designs.</p><p>Building your keyboard also lets you choose its size, from as small as 40% to as large as 100%.</p><h3 id=wider-selection-of-parts-and-styles>Wider Selection of Parts and Styles</h3><p>There's a wide selection of keyboard switch types online, starting from around $0.20 per switch. When selecting a switch, it's crucial to consider the switch type, whether <a href=#>linear, tactile, or clicky</a>.</p><p>Typing enthusiasts can opt for Drop Halo Clear tactile switches for an early, distinct bump or lubed Glorious Panda tactile switches for a satisfying tactile feel. Some mentionable gaming switches include Akko Wine Red (similar to Cherry MX Red), Glorious Lynx (hand-lubed, very light), and Gateron Oil King (heavier, ideal for intense gaming).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can customize almost every aspect of switches, including switch material, spring weight, and click smoothness. Depending on switch types and setups, these adjustments can deliver soft or stiff typing feels and produce varied typing sounds, from deep to clacky.</p><p>Custom keyboards offer both soldered and hot-swappable PCBs, allowing you to easily change switches or solder them securely. They also allow upgrades to enhance the typing experience, like adding foam to reduce hollowness and lubricating switches and stabilizers (stabs) to minimize rattling.</p><p>Pre-made keyboards are a bit of a gamble; while some brands lubricate their switches and stabs, they are typically unsatisfactory. For instance, there are isolated cases of sharp spring pinging sounds in specific Razer Huntsman Elite keyboards and stabilizers rattling in select Corsair K70 models.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=higher-quality-parts>Higher Quality Parts</h3><p>Custom mechanical keyboard kits often include aluminum cases and brass weights, resulting in a more premium feel than pre-built keyboards. Premium kits like the GMMK Pro and Akko ACR Pro 75 opt for a gasket mount, enhancing typing comfort compared to the typical plate-mounted design.</p><p>In addition, custom keyboard enthusiasts often prefer screw-in stabilizers for their direct PCB attachment and extensive customization options.</p><h2 id=disadvantages-of-custom-mechanical-keyboards>Disadvantages of Custom Mechanical Keyboards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/disassembled-mechanical-keyboard.jpg><p>Custom mechanical keyboards allow the customization of components like the base, switches, and keycaps. However, they also have downsides that could deter potential users from opting for them.</p><h3 id=higher-price>Higher Price</h3><p>Custom-built keyboards can be pricey, ranging from around $200 to over $500, depending on the quality of keyboard parts and added special features.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You'll need to purchase a soldering iron and keyboard components to build a custom keyboard. Even if you opt for a hot-swappable case, you'll still need to buy lube.</p><p>The main components you'll need to build a mechanical keyboard include a PCB (printed circuit board), case, backplate, stabs, switches, keycaps, and USB cable.</p><h3 id=need-to-assemble>Need to Assemble</h3><p>Building a mechanical keyboard from scratch can be time-consuming, taking hours or days. Beginners often risk encountering compatibility issues and potentially damaging customizable parts.</p><h2 id=advantages-of-pre-built-mechanical-keyboards>Advantages of Pre-Built Mechanical Keyboards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/05/redmagic-mechanical-keyboard-connected-via-bluetooth-to-a-macbook-air.jpg><p>If you've never used a mechanical keyboard and are unsure about different board and switch options, buying a pre-built one is a sensible decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=no-assembly-required>No Assembly Required</h3><p>When you buy a pre-built mechanical keyboard, you can use it immediately unless you take an eternity to settle on one.</p><h3 id=protected-by-a-warranty>Protected by a Warranty</h3><p>Buying a pre-built keyboard is safer if you're concerned about fixing mechanical keyboard problems. They are ready for use, and the seller or manufacturer deals with common keyboard problems.</p><p>On the downside, though, opening certain keyboards, like the Razer BlackWidow V4 75%, voids their warranty. That said, building your own keyboard means taking full responsibility for issues.</p><h3 id=often-cheaper>Often Cheaper</h3><p>Opting for a pre-built keyboard is ideal for budget-conscious users seeking immediate use and aren't too concerned about appearance or typing feel.</p><p>You can easily find high-performing pre-built mechanical keyboards for under $100 from well-known brands, including Razer, Corsair, and Royal Kludge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the best budget-friendly keyboards is the ROYAL KLUDGE RK61, <a href=#>a 60% gaming keyboard</a> designed for small spaces and mobility. The keyboard features a hot-swappable PCB, offers Bluetooth connectivity, and can run for up to 13 hours on a single charge.</p><h3 id=improved-software>Improved Software</h3><p>Many custom mechanical keyboards feature open-source firmware, like <a href=#>QMK for programming</a>, supporting features like RGB customization, combination keys, and multi-layer setup. However, they often lack the software integration capabilities seen in mainstream pre-built keyboards, like Logitech's GHub or Razer's Synapse.</p><h2 id=disadvantages-of-pre-built-mechanical-keyboards>Disadvantages of Pre-Built Mechanical Keyboards</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/frustrated-gamer.jpg><p>Pre-built keyboards may be easy to find but have their fair share of drawbacks. These include restricted customizability and warranty limitations, limited size options, and sometimes overpriced, lower-quality builds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many pre-built mechanical keyboards have soldered switches, limiting your ability to change them. However, some keyboards, like Logitech's G Pro X and Xtrfy's K5, offer hot-swappable switches.</p><p>Pre-built keyboard manufacturers often use switches from companies like Cherry and Gateron, leading to many keyboards with similar typing experience. On the other hand, custom keyboard builders can choose switches from any manufacturer for unique key feels.</p><p>That said, you can easily change the keycaps on most pre-built keyboards to your liking. However, ensure the keycaps match your keyboard, as some brands use non-standard key sizes.</p><h2 id=pre-built-vs-custom-mechanical-keyboards-which-one-should-you-buy>Pre-Built vs. Custom Mechanical Keyboards: Which One Should You Buy?</h2><p>Custom mechanical keyboards let you customize almost everything, including layout, switches, and keycaps, to your preferences. They cater to individuals seeking specific features unavailable in pre-built keyboards and customization enthusiasts with the skills or budget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pre-built keyboards are ideal for those who prefer performance, polished software, and minimal customization. Opting for a pre-built keyboard enables you to try out mechanical keyboards, discover your preferences, and eventually find or build the perfect custom keyboard.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiarqukpLpuwtJmp6udXZfCqrjTZq6hoZOdeq6xwqGYp6GTlrlut8SymaiZopl6tLTOrqOdZamkwm6u1LJm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcustom-vs-pre-built-which-mechanical-keyboard-should-you-buy.html&text=Which%20Mechanical%20Keyboard%20Should%20You%20Buy%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcustom-vs-pre-built-which-mechanical-keyboard-should-you-buy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcustom-vs-pre-built-which-mechanical-keyboard-should-you-buy.html&title=Which%20Mechanical%20Keyboard%20Should%20You%20Buy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcustom-vs-pre-built-which-mechanical-keyboard-should-you-buy.html&title=Which%20Mechanical%20Keyboard%20Should%20You%20Buy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcustom-vs-pre-built-which-mechanical-keyboard-should-you-buy.html&title=Which%20Mechanical%20Keyboard%20Should%20You%20Buy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcustom-vs-pre-built-which-mechanical-keyboard-should-you-buy.html&description=Which%20Mechanical%20Keyboard%20Should%20You%20Buy%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chad-michael-murray-9-year-wedding-anniversary-sarah-roemer-disaster.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Chad Michael Murray Says His Nine-Year Wedding Anniversary To Sarah Roemer Was A 'Disaster'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-kittl-vs-canva-comparison.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Kittl?

It hosts over one million suppliers from China who provide a wide variety of services. The site offers a fast and easy buying experience, where you add products you want into your cart – whether you are buying wholesale or retail. Which other websites like DHgate can you use to import from China?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2584b1fd78564cc8.jpg><p class=align-left>While DHgate is an excellent site to buy from, you must be wary of unscrupulous sellers or fraudsters. It is also possible that you might be looking for a little more variety in sellers, products, and even payment and <a href=#>shipping methods</a>.</p><h2>10 best websites like DHgate</h2><p class=align-left>DHgate is based in Beijing, China but has several offices worldwide. Below are the top websites similar to DHgate that you can use to purchase and ship items from China:</p><h3>1. Alibaba</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Alibaba </a>is one of the largest eCommerce websites, not just in China but worldwide. It was founded in 1999, making it one of the first pioneers of <a href=#>online shopping</a>. Its establishment made it easy to find, negotiate, and purchase products from Chinese suppliers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3698fe499cdacd97.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best apps to buy dogecoin online legitimately in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Alibaba </a>is, however, not like most eCommerce websites. It is a B2B (business to business) platform that caters to businesses, not individual consumers. On top of that, it does not sell products. Instead, Chinese suppliers list the products and services they offer – you can then contact them and reach an agreement.</p><p class=align-left>It is thus a great site if you are shopping around for suppliers. The site also offers excellent wholesale prices – as you are dealing directly with manufacturers/suppliers. You can also get a wide variety of products, with some suppliers even offering a custom design option.</p><h3>2. AliExpress</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">AliExpress</a> is another one of the top sites like DHgate for importing from China. It was launched in 2010 and is owned by the same parent company that owns Alibaba. However, it is a B2C (business to customer) platform, which caters to individual consumers.</p><p class=align-left>AliExpress is a great site to use as it connects you to several Chinese suppliers, thus guaranteeing a wide variety of goods. It has also gained a reputation for high-quality products at competitive wholesale prices.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/efe005d7f2adfe01.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to shop from AliExpress in Kenya: A comprehensive guide</span></p></a><p class=align-left>AliExpress also supports different payment methods – credit cards, debit cards, virtual credit cards, bank transfers, and more. Most sellers also accept <a href=#>PayPal</a> – making it one of the top sites like DHgate that accept PayPal.</p><h3>3. Chinabrands</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chinabrands</a> is another top online shopping website, which is based in Shenzhen, China. It was founded in 2007 and is quickly becoming one of the top places to purchase products from Chinese suppliers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3698fe499cdacd97.jpg><p class=align-left>There are lots of reasons to use Chinabrands to import products from China. First, it offers many goods – from clothing, jewellery, electronics, and others. Second, it also supports different payment options – Payoneer, <a href=#>PayPal</a>, wire transfer, etc. On top of that, it has built a reputation for fast and reliable shipping.</p><h3>4. Banggood</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Banggood</a> is another one of the top eCommerce websites like DHgate and AliExpress. It is a business-to-customer platform that offers a marketplace where Chinese merchants can showcase and sell their products to global customers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs37ok8dk9h1og.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best branding companies in Kenya to consider</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Banggood offers various goods – from electronics to clothes, jewellery, mobile phones and related accessories, household goods, and more. The prices offered are very competitive, as you deal directly with wholesale merchants and manufacturers. The site also offers a drop shipping service, which is excellent for people looking to venture into the online eCommerce business.</p><h3>5. Made-in-China</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Made-in-China </a>is another b2b e-commerce site that is based in Nanjing, China. It was founded in 1998, making it another one of the pioneers of online shopping. The company that operates the site has several warehouses in China and worldwide – mainly Europe and the USA.</p><p class=align-left>Made-in-China provides access to a large variety of goods from Chinese manufacturers and trading companies. In addition, it offers different payment options such as PayPal, letter of credit, electronic transfer, <a href=#>western</a> union, and more.</p><p class=align-left>One of the top benefits of using Made-in-China is the high level of seller-buyer trust. Suppliers are charged a yearly membership fee, which weeds out fraudsters. The site also has an Audited Suppliers program, which constantly vets the merchants to guarantee buyer protection.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8c74843a8cba2215.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 profitable businesses to start with 50k in Kenya (top ideas)</span></p></a><h3>6. DealExtreme</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">DealExtreme </a>is another one of the several sites like DHgate that connect buyers to Chinese suppliers. It was launched in 2005, primarily as a way of offering low-priced, high-quality gadgets to consumers. Today, the site offers several different products ranging from tech gadgets to electronics, office supplies, household goods, clothing, cosmetics, and more.</p><p class=align-left>DealExtreme is a great site to use due to its wide range of products. It is also famous for its low prices and includes several promotions, coupons, and <a href=#>gift</a> items. On top of that, the site rates its vendors and charges annual membership fees, which helps vet suppliers.</p><h3>7. Yiwu go</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Yiwu go </a>is another top eCommerce website for importing products from China. The company behind the site is based in China and mainly attracts suppliers and manufacturers from the Yiwu International Trade City. It offers a wide range of clothing, toys and novelty products, household items, party supplies, and more.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f6fec6ad1bf33f2a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to open and verify your Skrill account</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Yiwu is a great site to use, whether you are purchasing in bulk or just looking to shop for a few items. Suppliers have low minimum order quantities – around 10, but you can even purchase even one or two products with some. They also have great prices, which usually reduce as the number of pieces per product you buy increases. The company also operates a smartphone app, which you can use for all your transactions.</p><h3>8. Global Sources</h3><p class=align-left>If you are looking for an alternative to the DHgate shopping experience, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Global Sources</a> is another excellent website to consider. It is a one-stop eCommerce platform that offers many goods, from <a href=#>fashion</a> apparel to household goods, hardware items, electronics, auto parts, and machinery products.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/efe005d7f2adfe01.png><p class=align-left>Global Sources is a great site to use as it is both an online marketplace and a trade show facilitator. It is therefore ideal when you are sourcing high-quality goods or reliable merchants. The company also uses advanced buyer safety features, such as verified manufactures and verified certificates and budges for companies and products.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3bc5bef2ad7b6df3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Current 4G Capital Kenya products, address and contacts</span></p></a><h3>9. Taobao</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Taobao</a> is a b2c e-commerce platform that mainly offers electronic products. However, you can also purchase clothing, jewellery, household appliances, and several other products from the site. It is owned by the same company as Alibaba and AliExpress.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, they are known for having high-quality products and offering excellent service. It is a great site to purchase from if you want a fast shopping and shipping experience. However, the site has one major drawback – language barrier – but you can overcome this by using online translation extensions.</p><h3>10. 1688</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">1688</a> is another eCommerce website like DHgate, owned by Alibaba Group (the parent company for Alibaba and AliExpress). It is both a B2B and B2C marketplace, connecting Chinese manufacturers and suppliers to business and individual customers.</p><p class=align-left>Like other Alibaba Group websites, 1688.com offers access to many products at competitive wholesale prices. The site is also famous for providing early and first-hand access to new items. However, it primarily caters to domestic customers, so you must overcome the language barrier and shipping limitations when looking to import.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs47gaqdr0kjt.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>eBay shipping to Kenya:process, companies, and costs</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The above are some of the top websites like DHgate that you can use to import products from China. In addition, they come with several benefits, which might not be available with DHgate depending on what you are looking to import. Therefore, with these extra options, you can choose the right e-commerce platform to guarantee you the best shopping experience.</p><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> published an article about 15 best<a href=#> sites like Fingerhut </a>to buy now and pay later.

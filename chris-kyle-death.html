They were taking a fellow Marine, <strong>Eddie Ray Routh</strong>, to Texas gun range to help him. The hunk is the one who pointed his gun at his two mentors and shoots them both with numerous bullets in their heads, chest, and back.</p><h4><a href=# rel=noopener><i>Candace Cameron Bure Net worth, Height, Age, Relationship, Career, Instagram>></i></a></h4><p>Kyle worked with people who were indulged in the military and suffered from some shooting issues. Both of them were well armed with 45 calibers 1911 style pistols. Sources suggest that Eddie had Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.</p><p>Along with that, Routh used to come in and out of the mental hospitals quite often. To cope up with his shooting problem, Chris and Chad were assigned to assist him. This sniper felt something odd was going and texted Chad, saying, “This dude is straight nuts on the way to the shooting.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvstarsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/chris-kyle-11.jpg><p>To that, Littlefield responded, “Watch my six,” which means to watch my back. Later on, it was reported that Littlefield shot Chris with a 45-caliber pistol and Chad with a 9 SIG Sauer pistol. Surprisingly both of them belonged to Kyle. After shooting them with numerous bullets, the Marine corps veteran drove to his sister’s home and revealed the situation.</p><p>His sister <strong>Laura Blevins</strong> then informed 911, and he was captured. Later his trial was initiated on May 5, 2014, and he was found guilty on February 24, 2015. His prosecutors had already decided that he won’t have the death penalty. As a result, he was convicted of the murder of two and was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Was_Chris_Kyle_Born-_Childhood_and_Education></span>Where Was Chris Kyle Born?- Childhood and Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Chris Scott Kyle was born and raised in the beautiful place of Odessa, Texas. He was born to a loving mother, <strong>Deborah Lynn</strong>, and father, <strong>Wayne Kenneth Kyle.</strong> His father was active as a teacher at Sunday School. Kyle was blessed to have another brother.</p><p>It was his father who trained him to shoot at the tender age of eight. During that time, Wayne bought him a 30-06 Springfield rifle and later gave him a shotgun. The father and son used to group hunting the deer, quail pheasant, and whatnot.</p><h4><a href=# rel=noopener><i>Dakota Johnson Parents, Siblings, Height, Relationship, Instagram>></i></a></h4><p>Along with his brother, they used to take care of the 150 cattle at that time. Talking about education, this Sniper had been to a high school located in Midlothian, Texas. After that, Chris received his graduation in 1992 and was keen on bronco rodeo and ranch hand.</p><p>In 1992, this handsome man enrolled in Tarleton State University and studied Ranch and Range Management. Eventually, he became a professional bronco rodeo rider but did not pursue his career as Chris was injured.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Was_Chris_Born></span>When Was Chris Born?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This legendary sniper was born in the year of 1974 on the 8th day of April. At the time of his unfortunate death, he was just 38 years old and was very healthy and fit. The most definitive feature of this man was his golden-brown beard and well-built body. Moreover, he was an American man who came from white ethnicity.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_The_Wife_of_Chris_Kyle></span>Who Is The Wife of Chris Kyle?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This American sniper was spending his days happily with beautiful lady <strong>Taya Ranae Studebaker.</strong> She s the daughter of Mayor<strong> Kent Studebaker.</strong> They met each other for the first time in 2001 and eventually decided to walk down the aisle. During their time together, they were blessed to have two children.</p><p>This lovey-dovey couple has son <strong>Colton</strong> and daughter <strong>McKenna</strong> who are a year and a half apart. Although there are several things known about this couple, very few are known about their children. However, we are well aware that the nickname of their eldest child is <strong>Bubba</strong>, and the youngest daughter is <strong>Angel</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvstarsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/chris-kyle-10.webp><p>After her husband’s death, Kyle chose to advocate for the widowed women and families who have lost serving family members. In 2014, she founded a Chris Kyle Frog Foundation to provide a relatable experience for the veterans and their families. Although Chris is no more in her life, this lady has not been able to date other men.</p><p>She said, “My heart just wasn’t ready. I felt like it would be a betrayal. I was stubborn and hard-headed about it.” Currently, this mother of two is busy raising two kids to establish themselves well in their life.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_The_Net_Worth_of_Chris_Kyle></span>What Is The Net Worth of Chris Kyle?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Being one of the lethal snipers in the history of the United States military, Chris had made a big amount of money from his career.

Later on, Jesse sued him for defamation of character and received a huge sum of<strong> $1.8 million.</strong></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Social_Media_Presence></span>Social Media Presence<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Unfortunately, Chris is not active on any social media platforms.

At first, he did not make it to the exam as he had a pin in his arms but later was invited to Basic Underwater Demolition/Seal, Air-Land training in 1999.</li><li>After that, he worked in the SEAL Team-3, where he was a sniper and contributed to several battles in the Iraq war.</li><li>Until now, 150 kills by Kyle have been confirmed by Pentagon, but he has never established the number of killings. However, once he suggested that anyone is willing to know the number of kills, then directly ask the Navy, and you may know the truth if you catch them on the right day.</li><li>During his journey, he carried four extravagant weapons. A semi-automatic 7.62 NATO Mk 11 sniper rifle, a 5.56 NATO Mk 12 Designated Marksman Rifle, 300 Winchester Magnum Accuracy International, and a 338 Lapua Magnum.</li><li>Surprisingly this man left the NACY in 2009 and migrated to Midlothian, Texas, along with his kids and wife.</li><li><strong>Rick Perry</strong> signed Senate Bill 162, often known as the Chris Kyle Bill, in August 2013 to acknowledge military training in the awarding of occupational licenses.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Facts></span>Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>Chris was the deadliest U.S. Military Sniper in the history of the United States.</li><li>His autobiography reached Number 1 on the New York Times bestseller list of nonfiction.</li><li>At first, Kyle was rejected from the Navy as he had an old rodeo injury and a mark of pins in his arms.

Finally, he was recruited.</li><li>He was also the president of Craft International, a firm that provides military-style training to security personnel and law enforcement.</li><li>The leading secret behind how he was able to kill so many targets was because he could see the most targets. That is the reason why Chris got a nickname is Ninja Smoke.</li><li>It is claimed that Chris has killed 255 people, among which there is only a record of the killing of 150 people.</li><li>Kyle refers to <strong>Carlos Hathcock,</strong> a legend in Vietnam, as “The best sniper in the world” who records 93 people.</li><li>Chris was one of the legendary executioners of the insurgents that there was a bounty of <strong>$80,000</strong> on his head.

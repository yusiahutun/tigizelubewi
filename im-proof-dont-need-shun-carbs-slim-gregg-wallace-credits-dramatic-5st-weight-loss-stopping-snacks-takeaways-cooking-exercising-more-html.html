Now he is around 12 stone, pictured right</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Discussing his new podcast, A Piece of Cake, on BBC Radio 2's Michael Ball Show yesterday, he said: 'There's so much conflicting information out there, it's hard to know what to do.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In one episode, Dr Giles Yeo, a world-renowned geneticist from the University of Cambridge and author of Why Calories Don't Count, said that exercising to lose weight is the 'silliest thing you can possibly do', according to Gregg.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Gregg used the example of a 250 calorie chocolate bar.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: 'As he quite rightly pointed out, you'd have to be on a treadmill for 30 to 40 minutes just to get rid of the chocolate bar. That's without the takeaway pizza, the half bottle of rose and some chocolate biscuits on the sofa.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Gregg launched his own weight loss business, Gregg Wallace Health (GWH), four years ago, which shares advice and recipes to help people lose weight.</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>Gregg's no-fuss plan couldn't be simpler</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>The basic principles of the GreggWallace.Health plan are to make a weekly meal plan and cook everything from scratch at home using simple, fresh ingredients.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To access all the resources, including 500 recipes, advice and a peer support group on Facebook, sign up to the website for £11.99 a month.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Booklets featuring tips on how to make healthier choices when eating out or getting takeaways, managing alcohol and eating for the menopause can be bought at an additional cost.</p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li class=class><span class=mol-style-bold>Plan your meals</span></li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font>Make a meal plan for each day of the week, choosing breakfasts, lunches and dinners you would like to eat from the recipes on Gregg's website. There are also options for people with intolerances or special dietary requirements.&nbsp;</p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li class=class><span class=mol-style-bold>&nbsp;Write a shopping list</span></li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font>Once you've chosen your meals, write out a list of all the ingredients you'll need to buy – and try not to be tempted by other things when you're in the supermarket. Research shows people who meal plan are about 20 per cent less likely to be obese and will eat a broader variety of fruit and vegetables – which is better for their overall health. Those who cook at home often also live longer, one study found. Planning meals can save money and reduce your food waste, too.</p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li class=class><span class=mol-style-bold>Cook from scratch</span></li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font>Each recipe comes with easy instructions as well as a step-by-step video. Some meals can be prepared in advance, so you can make your breakfast the night before, or prep your lunch in the morning to take to work. Gregg says that as long as you try to cook most meals for yourself, the odd takeaway or meal out isn't an issue.</p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li class=class><span class=mol-style-bold>Eat as much as you like</span></li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font>If you're hungry, you can double or triple the portion sizes of your home-cooked meals and can add as much extra fruit or veg as you like.</p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li class=class><span class=mol-style-bold>No snacking between meals</span></li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font>This is the one area in which Gregg is fairly inflexible. He says he 'doesn't believe' in snacking and that we don't need them in our lives. The idea is to eat heartily at meal-times so that you won't be hungry or tempted to fill up on things such as biscuits, crisps and chocolate bars.&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/health/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>Some users of the plan, which puts no food off-limits but discourages unhealthy snacking, say they have lost 12 stone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The promising programme has recently partnered with Loughborough University, where researchers are testing how well it works and hope it will get the backing of the NHS.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Discussing his own weight loss, Gregg said he got motivated to shift the scales after becoming 'more and more unhappy' with his appearance and becoming concerned about his health.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: 'I was getting really big. And there's a picture of me and my lovely mate John Torode in India. He looks lovely and I'm big – my shirt is hanging over my trousers, I wasn't happy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'At the same time, my doctor did a blood test and he said: "We need to do something Mr Wallace. This blood test sample, your cholesterol is through the roof. You're in for some big illness here."</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Those two things combined – being unhappy with how I looked and then the doctor telling me I was going to have a big heart attack – I started looking very closely at how I was living.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Gregg said he then tried 'all the diets under the sun and none of them work'. 'You just beat yourself up emotionally, you think you're weak willed,' he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He has previously detailed that he tried eating less, cutting out lunch, removing carbohydrates and Weight Watchers but he was 'always hungry and frustrated'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>What finally worked was 'stopping the snacks, stopping the takeaways and cooking more', Gregg said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said the Mediterranean diet&nbsp;— which includes plenty of wholemeal bread, wholewheat pasta and oats&nbsp;— is 'the best you can have' and pushed back on the idea that people need to cut carbohydrates from their diet.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Carbs — such as rice, cereal and oats&nbsp;— are packed with fibre, calcium and iron. They are the main source of nutrients and energy in people's diets.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Health experts have long disputed the claims made by some diets that cutting carbs is the key to weight loss. In fact, gram for gram, carbs contain fewer than half the calories of fat.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Gregg said: 'We all think we have to not have carbs. You think about this Mediterranean diet.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The French, the amount of bread they consume&nbsp;— all slim.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The Spanish, their patatas bravas and paellas, rice, potatoes — slim.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The Italians, the amount of pasta, but they're all slim. It's not the carbs.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said: 'What you won't see [in those countries] is loads and loads of takeaways.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'What you won't see is people eating crisps and chocolate.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They stop at lunch, an hour, two hours, so they can go and eat properly.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They're just eating proper meals.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'That's what I learnt, that's how I lost five stone, that's what I teach people, that's what the healthy places in the world are doing. They're eating proper food.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Gregg added that, while exercise is vital for maintaining weight loss, spending hours in the gym isn't vital for losing it in the first place.</p><img id=i-ed3f68a54987db3e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/02/05/09/79463299-0-Gregg_s_meals_are_inspired_by_a_classic_Mediterranean_diet_This_-a-4_1707125154530.jpg height=357 width=634 alt="Gregg¿s meals are inspired by a classic Mediterranean diet.

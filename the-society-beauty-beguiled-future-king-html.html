Its rococo interior was so grand that Queen Victoria, when she attended a dinner there many years before, had remarked on arrival: ‘I have come from my house to your palace.’</span></p><p><span>Prince Albert, known as Bertie, and his brother Edward, the Prince of Wales, circled the room as they were introduced to guests. Eventually the two princes reached a group of women in which Freda Dudley Ward (Edward’s secret lover) had positioned herself. Sheila Loughborough (who was married to Lord Loughborough) was standing next to Freda in a golden gown. They had not met before but Albert fell for Sheila’s wide eyes and insisted on a dance. Neither of them knew that this chance meeting would lead to a lifelong friendship, full of secrets.</span></p><br><p><b><span>'My Dear Sheila... I do so miss you...<br>I shall look forward to the day you return'</span></b></p><p><span>Sheila recalled later that, as the princes approached, she had asked Lady Rosemary Leveson-Gower, who was standing with her, what she should say and do. ‘Curtsey to the ground, call them sir and treat them like dirt,’ Rosemary replied. Sheila danced with both princes. She would also note in her memoir, ‘It was an enjoyable evening, and I told them my grandmother was a kangaroo!’</span></p><p><span>Edward’s relationship with Freda soon became all-consuming. They found ways of being together almost every day or, if they could not manage that, would scrawl gushing, embarrassing love notes to each other. And Bertie – quiet, hesitant and afflicted with a crippling stammer – was shadowing his elder brother, including losing his virginity to a Parisian prostitute as Edward had done. It was not surprising then that Bertie and Sheila, Freda’s best friend, morphed into a private social unit with Edward and Freda.</span></p><img id=i-5cbe0d2f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/23/article-0-1A9FE41800000578-307_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Smoking nonchalantly between Prince Albert, far left, and Prince Edwards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Smoking nonchalantly between Prince Albert, far left, and Prince Edwards</p><p><span>They called themselves the 4 Do’s, a nickname dreamed up by Edward, perhaps as a rebellion against being told what they couldn’t do – a secret club within their very public existence, marked with a teddy bear on the dashboard of Bertie’s car given to him by Sheila. They were dangerous, exciting liaisons for two young princes challenging social expectation; exploring their independence with two unhappily married women.</span></p><p><span>The 4 Do’s attended the theatre and music halls; they arranged dinner with friends who knew of the liaisons, and mingled carefully in public at dances and parties in the grand houses and ballrooms of West London. They even stole time at Freda and Sheila’s homes, sometimes under the noses of their husbands, who were either unaware of or ignored their wives’ indiscretions.</span></p><p><span>Sheila’s relationship with the gentle Bertie had developed beyond mere friendship. There was a mutual attraction, and from Sheila’s perspective a welcome distraction, as her marriage to Lord Loughborough (Loughie), who was a compulsive gambler, continued to disintegrate.<br></span></p><p><span>In the last days of May 1919, she waved goodbye to her mother, who finally returned to Sydney after five years abroad. Sheila was now alone with two children under the age of two, the rest of her family a six-week journey away by ship on the other side of the world.</span></p><p><span>As Sheila wrestled with her future and wondered at her improbable relationship with the second in line to the British throne, Lady Cunard invited her to lunch. It was an intimate affair held at Kenwood House in Hampstead, owned by the Guinness family, its walls lined with works by the great masters – Rembrandt, Vermeer, Turner, Reynolds, Gainsborough and Constable. ‘I sat opposite Serge Obolensky [a Russian prince],’ she would write of that day. ‘He only had to look at a woman for her to fall in love with him. He looked at me. My heart stood still.’</span></p><img id=i-5cf40d33 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/23/article-0-1A9FE51600000578-744_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="A portrait of Sheila, by then Lady Milbanke, by Simon Elwes from the late 1930s" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>A portrait of Sheila, by then Lady Milbanke, by Simon Elwes from the late 1930s</p><p><span>A week later Sheila and Loughie went to Scotland for a month to try to rekindle their marriage. When they returned to London, Sheila’s thoughts turned again to Serge. Bertie had been sent by his father to study at Trinity College, Cambridge.<br></span></p><p><span>Their relationship was cooling, but they continued to see each other when he was in London. Despite their efforts at secrecy it was only a matter of time before their affair and the liaison between Prince Edward and Freda Dudley Ward was reported back to Buckingham Palace. By April 1920 the activities of Edward and Albert had reached the ears of King George and Queen Mary.</span></p><p><span>King George decided to confront his errant sons. The issue was far more serious with the Prince of Wales, given that he was heir to the throne, but he was on his way to Australia for an official tour. So the king summoned his second son on 7 April and offered a tantalising inducement, as Bertie told his brother in a letter written the next morning. ‘He is going to make me Duke of York on his birthday provided that he hears nothing more about Sheila and me!!!’</span></p><p><span>After he had received his brother’s laments, some six weeks later, Edward wrote this outburst to Freda:</span></p><p><i><span>May 22, 11pm at sea</span></i></p><p><i><span>Christ! How I loathe and despise my bloody family as Bertie has written me three long, sad letters in which he tells me he’s getting it in the neck about his friendship with poor little Sheilie & that TOI ET MOI came in for it too!! But if HM thinks he’s going to alter me by insulting you he’s making just about the biggest mistake of his silly useless life…’</span></i></p><p><span>Edward, who would stand by his word and reject his father’s demands for an end to the relationship with Freda, had calmed down two days later when he penned a second letter. He and Freda had known about the relationship that had developed between ‘Sheilie and Ob [Obolensky]’ for several months – so his initial indignation on Bertie’s behalf had tempered considerably by his second letter.</span></p><p><i><span>May 24</span></i></p><p><i><span>You & I both happen to know that neither of them really mean anything to each other at all, do they sweetheart?…From what he tells me S & L [Loughie] are living on top of a hotter volcano than ever & anyone in love with her is sitting on top with them! We both of us know she really loves Ob so surely it would be better for Bertie to drift away from it all & just be one of Sheilie’s friends…</span></i></p><img id=i-aab70e6c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/27/article-2544791-1AE84F3200000578-302_634x503.jpg height=503 width=634 alt="Sheila, Edwards, Freda and Bertie - 'the 4 do's' - during a visit to Sheila's WInchester home Lankhills in 1919" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Sheila, Edwards, Freda and Bertie - 'the 4 do's' - during a visit to Sheila's WInchester home Lankhills in 1919</p><p><span>Bertie knew that he had to obey his father. Sheila was married, and even if she left Loughie, his parents would not approve of marriage to a divorcée. It would come to a head on the night of 2 June 1920, when King George hosted his traditional pre-Derby male-only dinner at Buckingham Palace for members of the Jockey Club. The next day was his 55th birthday, when he intended to appoint his second son as Duke of York. That evening Bertie, who had travelled down from Cambridge, wrote his father a note in which he said he was proud to accept the title and hoped he would live up to it, adding ‘I can tell you I fulfilled your conditions to the letter and that nothing more will come of it.’</span></p><p><span>Even though the prince would complain to his brother about being spied on every time he went out during that summer, there would be one last dance with his former lover. After signing his acceptance letter, Bertie went off to dinner at the palatial home of Lord and Lady Farquhar with his mother Queen Mary, his sister Princess Mary and his younger brothers George and Henry.<br></span></p><p><span>There were 76 guests at three tables decorated with sweet peas to celebrate the Farquhars’ silver wedding anniversary. They were joined after dinner by a further 150 guests, among them Sheila Loughborough, as the evening turned to dancing.</span></p><img id=i-47c10cf0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/23/article-0-1A77EFFC00000578-3_306x439.jpg height=439 width=306 alt="Queen Elizabeth and King George VI on their wedding day in 1923" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Queen Elizabeth and King George VI on their wedding day in 1923</p><img id=i-5d0e0d3a src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/23/article-0-1A77E77C00000578-920_306x439.jpg height=439 width=306 alt="The Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson on their wedding day in June 1937" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson on their wedding day in June 1937</p><p><span>Despite the presence of his mother and his commitment to his father, Bertie could not resist dancing with the woman he had agreed to avoid. As they took their turn around the dancefloor, they both noticed a young woman standing in the doorway. She seemed young and vulnerable – a debutante alone in a room filled with society veterans. She was the 19-year-old Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.</span></p><br><p><b><span>'Bertie tells me he's getting it in the neck about his friendship with Sheila'</span></b></p><p><span>In a desperate last attempt to save her marriage, Sheila persuaded Loughie to go back with her and the children to Australia for a year. When an envelope stamped with the royal seal arrived she opened it carefully. She then stored it among her most precious belongings, with the others that followed from Bertie.</span></p><p><i><span>December 20</span></i></p><p><i><span>My Dear Sheila,</span></i></p><p><i><span>Whenever I go into a ballroom I always look around the room hoping to see you, as I know there is somebody missing, and it is so so sad not seeing you, and I do so miss you…I shall look forward to the day when you return and I hope to be able to welcome you back once more.</span></i></p><p><i><span>My very best love for you Sheila</span></i></p><p><i><span>Yours ever sincerely<br>Albert</span></i></p><img id=i-60580d52 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/23/article-0-1A9FEDF500000578-524_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Sheila and Loughie prepare to board a ship back to London in 1923, after two years in Australia" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Sheila and Loughie prepare to board a ship back to London in 1923, after two years in Australia</p><img id=i-5ccc0d30 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/23/article-0-1A9FE07600000578-416_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Sheila with her second husband Sir John Milbanke on their wedding day in 1928" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Sheila with her second husband Sir John Milbanke on their wedding day in 1928</p><p><span>He had promised to give her up, but this letter made it clear that he was struggling to forget her.

Albert had proposed a second time to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon who, yet again, rejected him because she regarded their relationship as a friendship. He would try once more in February 1923. This time she accepted and they married on 26 April.</span></p><br><p><b><span>'My Dear Sheila... how very glad I am to hear that you are definitely coming home'</span></b></p><p><span>Two weeks later Sheila arrived back in London with her husband and their two sons. Sheila summed up their time in Australia succinctly and sadly: ‘We remained in Australia for nearly two and a half years and Loughie did not change at all.’</span></p><p><span>On 22 May, Elizabeth, the new Duchess of York, recorded in her diary how Prince Edward had come to dinner where they were staying at Windsor and suggested they drive to London for an evening of dancing at the Embassy Club: ‘So we dashed up to London in his car & joined Paul’s party there. Among Prince Paul’s guests were the Prince of Wales’ friend Freda Dudley Ward, Sheila Loughborough, Alice Astor, Prince Serge Obolensky and Lord Cranborne. Danced hard till 2.30. David sent us back in his car. Very tired & enjoyed it awfully.’</span></p><img id=i-5ec10d45 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/01/23/article-0-1A9FDC8200000578-854_306x423.jpg height=423 width=306 alt="Sheila posing as Penthesilea, Queen of the Amazons, in a photograph by Madame Yevonde, 1935" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Sheila posing as Penthesilea, Queen of the Amazons, in a photograph by Madame Yevonde, 1935</p><p><span>Sheila also made mention of the evening in her memoir, but from a different perspective: ‘The Prince of Wales was with us with Freda, of course, also the Duke and Duchess of York. Prince Bertie, now the Duke of York, had married the little debutante we had seen in the doorway…three years before, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.’</span></p><p><span>Sheila eventually divorced Loughie in 1926 and married Sir John Milbanke (‘Buffles’) in 1928. Sir John died in 1947 and in 1948 she opened a travel agency in Fortnum & Mason. In 1954, Sheila married Dimitri Romanov, a Russian prince. She died in 1969.</span></p><p><span>Prince Edward parted company from Freda Dudley Ward in 1934 when he met divorcée Mrs Wallis Simpson.

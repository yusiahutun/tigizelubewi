"Woke up this morning with a fiancée 💍❤️," he captioned the picture. "Appreciate my dawg @don_julio314 for helping me set everything up, she really had no clue what was coming 😂 @zofrost you went crazy on this one bro really made the night special 🙌🏽."<br></p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Owens is a safety for the Houston Texans.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 25-year-old NFL player grew up in St. Louis, MO. He started playing football in high school, then played college ball for Missouri Western State University. He first joined the NFL in 2018 and played for the Arizona Cardinals, before joining the Houston Texas practice squad in 2019. He officially signed with the Texans in 2020, and both he and Biles live in the Houston area.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">He and Biles are both loving pup parents.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Owens is a devoted dog dad to his two-year-old bulldog, Zeus. He also runs Zeus's Instagram, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/zeusthebulldog36/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@zeusthebulldog36 class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@zeusthebulldog36</a>. The description for Zeus's Instagram reads, "Most energetic English Bulldog you’ve ever met.

Biles and Owens's pups have even made each other's feeds, with captions referring to the pups as siblings. (The cutest!)</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Owens didn't recognize Biles at first.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple met over social media in March 2020, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/simone-biles-jonathan-owens-relationship/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Texas Monthly" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Texas Monthly</a>, but Owens didn't recognize the Biles from her iconic Instagram at first. "I didn’t know who she was," Owens told Texas Monthly. "I just hadn’t heard of her, and when I told her that, that’s one of the things she liked."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Owens went into more detail on how Biles impressed him in the episode of Simone vs Herself. "Her work ethic was really the first thing that caught my eye. I never really watched gymnastics before I first started talking to her. When I met her, I honestly didn’t know who she was. It was just kind of like, 'Oh, she’s got a lot of followers. You know, she must be pretty good or something.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He continued, "That’s how I would tell people, and they’re like, 'Simone Biles?! You for real, the gymnast?!' And I’m like, 'Man, she’s good like that?!' Like I didn’t [know]."</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The pandemic gave them the chance to get to know each other.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Both Owens and Biles both had big plans in early 2020, with Owens headed to training camp and Biles expected to compete in the Summer Olympics. When everything was postponed due to the pandemic, they had more time for each other, according to Texas Monthly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Owens said, "We ended up hanging out right before the pandemic. It was one of the few times in her life where everything was just shut off and she couldn’t do anything. So we used it to get to know each other—really get to know each other. It created our bond and made it stronger. Now I’m so thankful."</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Simone says the couple was "meant to be."</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the same Simone vs Herself episode, Biles explained how similar she and Owens are. "We vibe on the same level. We have the same kind of humor. We’re both athletic. We’re both elite athletes, so we definitely get each other. It was like it was meant to be," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Owens told Texas Monthly that he loves Biles' positive personality. "Her energy is something. She’s always happy, giggly, bubbly. If I’ve had a tough day at the office, I wouldn’t want to take that home to her. Her personality, man …"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He continued: "This was a match made in heaven. There’s no better person for me. She loves me, she’s so affectionate. I just love that. And it’s just intoxicating seeing how much work she puts into everything.'</p><h2 data-node-id=37 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The couple is super supportive of each other's athletic careers.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Biles told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/sports/tokyo-olympics-simone-biles-says-boyfriend-supportive-of-career/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a> last month that Owens is one of her biggest fans. "Oh, he's always so supportive. Even if I wake up in the morning and I'm like, 'I'm tired, do I have to go,' jokingly, he's like 'Don't say that! You can do it, this is your dream!'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He's always, always so helpful and making sure I stay on top of my therapy and all of that. He's the best because he also goes through it [as an athlete], so he knows exactly how it is in the process. It's been amazing to have him," she continued.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Owens got the chance to cheer on Biles in person as she won her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36647984/simone-biles-wins-seventh-national-womens-title/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="seventh national women's title" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">seventh national women's title</a>. He posted a sweet pic of the two congratulating Biles, with a caption that read, "First time getting to watch you compete in person and you didn’t disappoint. It’s so cool that i get to watch you do what you love, and be the best at that ‼️ I’m so proud of you my lil champ 🥰❤️ Trials up next and you already know I’m there!! Love you baby ❤️❤️."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Biles replied in a comment, "I love you so much 🤎 I’m so happy you got to come watch while in the middle of OTA’s 😘😘 you a real one."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Biles also supports Owens's football career, and attends his football games often. A November Instagram post shows Biles in Texans gear at the stadium. Her caption reads, "you know where to find me on sundays."</p><h2 data-node-id=45 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Biles called Owens her "favorite person" in a birthday tribute.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Biles didn't let her preparations for the Tokyo Olympics keep her from celebrating Owens' 26th birthday. She posted a sweet Instagram tribute July 22, with a slideshow of moments in the couple's relationship. "here in Japan it is already my favorite persons birthday 🖤 HAPPY 26th BIRTHDAY BABE. @jowens_3 I love you so much. Can’t wait to celebrate you when I get home!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She continued, "thanks for keeping me sane during the craziest times. an ear to vent too, someone to share fun times with and make the best of memories 🖤 not sure how I got so lucky & what I’d do without you! But I hope you have the best day ever. Not too much fun without me tho hahaha 🥺🤞🏾🤍 forever yours, S"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Owens commented under the post, "Thank you so much baby i love you ❤️❤️"</p><h2 data-node-id=50 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The couple celebrated their one-year anniversary with matching outfits.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Biles took to Instagram to celebrate her one-year anniversary with Owens, posting a sweet pic where the couple wore matching outfits on what appears to be a date night. In the pic, Biles and Owens wear orange shirts–a t-shirt for Owens and a tube top for Biles–with distressed light-wash jeans and white sneakers. The gymnast also included a candid caption, where she noted that the post was coming after their actual anniversary day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Oops I forgot to tell y’all that we’ve been dating for more than a year 🤍 so happy past 1 year to the best thing that’s ever happened to you: ME 🤍🤣," Biles wrote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Owens left a comment under the post, saying, "Time flies when your having fun ❤️🤪 To many more with you baby 🤞🏽."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/81e105b4-86bd-4dab-a1f8-e00063b9e433_1609381211.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" title="Headshot of Quinci LeGardye" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Quinci LeGardye is an LA-based freelance writer who covers culture, politics, and mental health through a Black feminist lens.

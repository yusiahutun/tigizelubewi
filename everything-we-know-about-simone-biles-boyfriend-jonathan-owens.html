"I didn‚Äôt know who she was," Owens told Texas Monthly. "I just hadn‚Äôt heard of her, and when I told her that, that‚Äôs one of the things she liked."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Owens went into more detail on how Biles impressed him in the episode of Simone vs Herself. "Her work ethic was really the first thing that caught my eye. I never really watched gymnastics before I first started talking to her. When I met her, I honestly didn‚Äôt know who she was. It was just kind of like, 'Oh, she‚Äôs got a lot of followers. You know, she must be pretty good or something.'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He continued, "That‚Äôs how I would tell people, and they‚Äôre like, 'Simone Biles?! You for real, the gymnast?!' And I‚Äôm like, 'Man, she‚Äôs good like that?!' Like I didn‚Äôt [know]."</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The pandemic gave them the chance to get to know each other.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Both Owens and Biles both had big plans in early 2020, with Owens headed to training camp and Biles expected to compete in the Summer Olympics. When everything was postponed due to the pandemic, they had more time for each other, according to Texas Monthly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Owens said, "We ended up hanging out right before the pandemic. It was one of the few times in her life where everything was just shut off and she couldn‚Äôt do anything. So we used it to get to know each other‚Äîreally get to know each other. It created our bond and made it stronger. Now I‚Äôm so thankful."</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Simone says the couple was "meant to be."</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the same Simone vs Herself episode, Biles explained how similar she and Owens are. "We vibe on the same level. We have the same kind of humor. We‚Äôre both athletic. We‚Äôre both elite athletes, so we definitely get each other. It was like it was meant to be," she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Owens told Texas Monthly that he loves Biles' positive personality. "Her energy is something. She‚Äôs always happy, giggly, bubbly. If I‚Äôve had a tough day at the office, I wouldn‚Äôt want to take that home to her. Her personality, man ‚Ä¶"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He continued: "This was a match made in heaven. There‚Äôs no better person for me. She loves me, she‚Äôs so affectionate. I just love that. And it‚Äôs just intoxicating seeing how much work she puts into everything.'</p><h2 data-node-id=37 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">The couple is super supportive of each other's athletic careers.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Biles told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/sports/tokyo-olympics-simone-biles-says-boyfriend-supportive-of-career/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a> last month that Owens is one of her biggest fans. "Oh, he's always so supportive. Even if I wake up in the morning and I'm like, 'I'm tired, do I have to go,' jokingly, he's like 'Don't say that! You can do it, this is your dream!'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"He's always, always so helpful and making sure I stay on top of my therapy and all of that. He's the best because he also goes through it [as an athlete], so he knows exactly how it is in the process. It's been amazing to have him," she continued.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Owens got the chance to cheer on Biles in person as she won her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a36647984/simone-biles-wins-seventh-national-womens-title/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="seventh national women's title" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">seventh national women's title</a>. He posted a sweet pic of the two congratulating Biles, with a caption that read, "First time getting to watch you compete in person and you didn‚Äôt disappoint. It‚Äôs so cool that i get to watch you do what you love, and be the best at that ‚ÄºÔ∏è I‚Äôm so proud of you my lil champ ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è Trials up next and you already know I‚Äôm there!!

A November Instagram post shows Biles in Texans gear at the stadium. Her caption reads, "you know where to find me on sundays."</p><h2 data-node-id=45 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Biles called Owens her "favorite person" in a birthday tribute.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Biles didn't let her preparations for the Tokyo Olympics keep her from celebrating Owens' 26th birthday. She posted a sweet Instagram tribute July 22, with a slideshow of moments in the couple's relationship. "here in Japan it is already my favorite persons birthday üñ§ HAPPY 26th BIRTHDAY BABE. @jowens_3 I love you so much.
